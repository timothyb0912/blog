# Lemonade from lemons


## Problem

Dear Young Tim,

Looking back over the past year,
procrastination has been a constant companion and problem of ours.
For this discussion,
we'll define procrastination
as either of the following two conditions.
Condition one:
having a plan for one's time,
yet hesitating to do what one planned,
AND feeling that such hesitation
was not in one's long-term best interest.
Condition two:
hesitating to make a plan for one's time,
AND feeling that such hesitation
was not in one's long-term best interest.

Given the definition above,
procrastination can be viewed as a detrimental practice,
to be stopped as soon as possible.
To this end, one straightforward strategy is to
try to stop hesitating on one's planned tasks or on planning.

However, pause for a moment and imagine a complementary way.
How could we respond if we viewed our hesitation as
as having a positive intent?
Per our definition above,
a second strategy to 'stop procrastinating'
is to take action such that
our hesitation still supports our long-term best interests.
Then hesitation would be free of guilt and detrimental qualities;
it would not be procrastination.
Practically, how can we design a set of actions that together
transform our hesitation from procrastination into production
for our long-term interests?

Most comprehensively, our problem can be stated as follows.
Given that we sense many aspects
of our physical and social environment,
when we interpret one or more of our sensations
as indicating our unmet needs,
then we commonly feel intense emotional activation,
and we hesitate to do that which we planned
or we hesitate to plan.
Meanwhile, we anxiously observe the racing of our polarized thoughts.
Finally, we then feel secondary guilt
for 'spending' our time with nothing to show for it,
i.e. acting against our long-term best interests.
Of course, we prefer to act in ways that do NOT
result in anxiety or guilt.

What we really want or need is
a way to productively channel our thoughts and feelings,
if and while we hesitate,
so that we identify, assess, and eventually satisfy
our unmet needs.
THAT would be in our long-term best interests.
