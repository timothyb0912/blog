# Lemonade from lemons


## Problem

Dear Young Tim,

Looking back over the past year,
procrastination has been a constant companion and problem of ours.
For this discussion,
we'll define procrastination
as either of the following two conditions.
Condition one:
having a plan for our time,
yet hesitating to do what we planned,
AND feeling that such hesitation
was not in our long-term best interest.
Condition two:
hesitating to make a plan for our time,
AND feeling that such hesitation
was not in our long-term best interest.

Given the definition above,
procrastination can be viewed as a detrimental practice,
to be stopped as soon as possible.
To this end, one straightforward strategy is to
try to stop hesitating on one's planned tasks or on planning.

However, pause for a moment and imagine a complementary way.
How could we respond if we viewed our hesitation
as having a positive intent?
Per our definition above,
a second strategy to 'stop procrastinating'
is to take action such that
our hesitation still supports our long-term best interests.
Then hesitation would be free of guilt and detrimental qualities;
it would not be procrastination.
Practically, how can we design a set of actions that together
transform our hesitation from procrastination into production
for our long-term interests?

Most comprehensively, our problem can be stated as follows.
Given that we sense many aspects
of our physical and social environment,
when we interpret one or more of our sensations
as indicating our unmet needs,
then we commonly feel intense emotional activation,
and we hesitate to do that which we planned
or we hesitate to plan.
Meanwhile, we anxiously observe the racing of our polarized thoughts.
Finally, we then feel secondary guilt
for 'spending' our time with nothing to show for it,
i.e. acting against our long-term best interests.
Of course, we prefer to act in ways that do NOT
result in anxiety or guilt.

What we really want or need is
a way to productively channel our thoughts and feelings,
if and while we hesitate,
so that we identify, assess, and eventually satisfy
our unmet needs.
THAT would be in our long-term best interests.


## Solution

So, what can we do?
One hypothesis is that if we use communication templates,
then we will increase the percentage of time that
hesitation leads to production rather than procrastination.
The idea is that
we can design the template with cues for information
we need for contextualizing and responding
to the problems that motivated our hesitation.
Then, instead of being lost in thought while procrastinating,
we can combine our thoughts with the template,
crafting a story that serves as a record of the problem
for ourselves and anyone else who might help us.
We can write, type, or speak our message based on the template,
and we can store the resulting document / file for later.


What might such a template look like?
As a useful example to begin with,
consider the following template for "emotional problem-statements":

> I observe that GIVEN {{these-circumstances}}
> WHEN {{this-happens}}
> THEN [facing {{these-concerns}}]
> I decide to FEEL {{these-feelings}}
> in order to satisfy {{these-NEEDS}}
> and accepting {{these-downsides}}.
> So far, I have taken {{these-steps}} to fulfill my needs,
> and for further help, I am REQUESTING {{these-actions}}.


Elements in curly-braces, i.e. '{' and '}',
are to be replaced with our own descriptions.
Clauses with rectangular-braces, i.e. '[' and ']',
are considered optional and to be included at a
communicator's discretion.


## Outcomes

So far, using this template has been greatly helpful.
Since adopting it,
every time I hesitated to plan or execute my plans,
I have generated multiple, actionable, requests.
Typically, I've generated one or more request per
activated inner part,
and when hesitating,
it's almost always the case for me
that two or more inner parts are activated and polarized.
Accordingly, I come away with a collection of requests,
and as I slowly fulfill them,
I've experienced less frequent bouts of hesitation.
This helps accomplish the first
procrastination reduction strategy of not hesitating so much.


Simultaneously, by producing these records of
what happened, what I'm feeling, and what I need and want,
I document the mindfulness and emotional regulation work
described in therapeutic modalities like
[dialectical behavior therapy](https://dbtselfhelp.com/dbt-skills-list/emotion-regulation/).
By producing such templated documents,
i.e. by standardizing and tracking emotional data,
I bypass feelings the guilt of procrastination,
and I instead feel proud of translating my raw emotions into
information that can then be acted upon and analyzed.
This helps accomplish the second
procrastination reduction strategy of
making hesitation productive.
These emotional problem-statements enter the top of a
productivity funnel that starts with problem logging,
continues with problem observation, hypothesizing,
and experimenting,
and ends with problem resolution.
