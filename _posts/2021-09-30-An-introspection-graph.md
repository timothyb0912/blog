# An introspection graph

Dear Young Tim,

This post follows the recent stream of psychology focused dispatches.
The context is the familiar one:
we face problems in life where there is a
discrepancy between feelings we have and feelings we want,
and between outcomes we have and outcomes we want.
In order to achieve the feelings and outcomes we desire,
it is helpful to understand how we ended up in our undesired states in the first
place. Moreover, I believe it is beneficial to take a systematic approach to
understanding one's issue.

In particular, I think it's helpful to have a set of questions to start from
when tyring to understand our personal problems.
