# Emotional leveraging
Dear Young Tim,

It's no secret that we're highly sensitive.
Most literally, we sense a lot of things, often simultaneously.
We register these sensations in our body and mind as feelings.
We feel a lot of things.

Sometimes these sensations start in the external world,
as with hearing a song.
Other times, these sensations frequently start in our inner world,
as when we become angered at a thought
and our heart rate quickens as a result.
And of course, when faced with sudden, unexpected challenges,
we feel all manner of emotions at once.
In all cases, as said above, we feel a lot of things.

Having many feelings is neither death sentence nor deliverance.
Having many feelings can be a curse or it can be a blessing.

If we don't learn to leverage our emotional waves,
we can drown in our feelings.
We've lost weeks to tears.
We've spent countless hours miscarrying bursts of excitement.
We've sacrificed weeks appeasing fear-driven procrastination.

On the other hand,
we've produced fantastic bouts of problem-solving in short time,
when others have folded under pressure.
We've remained calm and effective in situations that could have turned fatal.
And we've benefitted from courage,
personally, academically and professionally.

What we want are more experiences of latter and less of the former.
What we need are processes to make use and fun (out) of our emotions.
We need procedures and techniques
to learn from our emotions,
to effectively create desired emotions when useful,
and to modify preseent emotions that are or are becoming detrimental.

## Process overview
So far, we've found the following process to be useful
for emotional leveraging.

1. Meet & greet our emotions
2. "Unblend" & meet needs
3. "Unburden" & change beliefs

We've culled this process from readings in
dialectical behavior therapy,
internal family systems,
the pattern system by Jay Earley,
and cognitive behavioral therapy.

Further, we were influenced by our earlier
thoughts about processes for understanding and altering
our thoughts (see Psychological Optimization)
and our actions (see Causally Engineering Life).
Just as those two processes align to each other,
(Casual Debugging --- Psychological Optimization)

- Immediate Response --- Integration
- Procedural Response --- Introspection
- Root Cause Response --- Education

so too do those processes align with
our emotional leveraging process above.
See discussion of this point in each section below.
