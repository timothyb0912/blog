# Personal Data Science: What, Why, and How

Dear Young Tim,

Congratulations on making it to the end of 2021!
Extra congratulations for making it here with out any permanent debilitations,
mentally or physically.
I wasn't sure we would see the end of the year in this state,
so there is much to celebrate!

Despite this good news, I'd like to offer you an apology.
In hindsight, it's clear that I did not protect us and meet our needs.
Accordingly, you and your twin protector of
~extreme-procrastination~ depression are fully active.
I've left you running about,
trying desperately to hold onto the few remaining goals
I've carried with me to the end of the year.

To be honest, relying only on our mind's awareness
and on our rotating present attention to keep track of things,
has left us exhausted and in shambles.
It has left us in a severe local minima.
Young Tim, in our hero's journey,
we're at the point of having begun the journey,
having achieved some success,
but nonetheless having come to hard times.
Now, it's time to change in order to experience better times in the future.

Part of this change will involve seeing therapists and coaches.
They're absolutely helpful.
However, we nevertheless face the decision of
"how will we interact with mental health professionals?"
As statistician Talithia Williams so aptly put it,
> Medical doctors [and mental health workers] are experts in the population,
> but we need to be experts in ourselves.

In a real sense,
we need to be head of "personal data science"
for our own mental health management.
There are good economic reasons for this.
For one, I have the greatest competitive advantage for this role.
I have direct access to what is going on in my mind at any time.
I can perform the data collection whereas others cannot.
I am also a professional data scientist.
Who is better suited to analyze my data productively, quickly, and thoroughly?

Finally, this data science for mental health role has a huge gap.
The role is not filled comprehensively or well
by the mental health professionals I have interacted with.
I suspect that I can play this role better than others,
and since it is not being done by others,
I may benefit from doing it.


## What is personal data science?

This discussion brings up the question of what is "personal data science,"
before we go too far down the rabbit hole of "why may I want to do this?"
The basic idea is that personal data science is
the application of data science perspectives and techniques
to the betterment of personal problems that one is facing,
with the aim of leading or managing oneself more effectively.
See the image below.

Some personal problems that are immediately relevant include
managing our emotions and moods on a daily basis
to accomplish the goals that we've set.
Another personal problem involves
ensuring that our exercise and nutrition
maintain our good health over the long-term.
Finally there is the question of
how can use direct health outcome data such as
our temperature, our blood pressure,
our blood glucose levels, and our heart rate?
If we collect and store our observations---our quantitive stories---
about these important topics,
then we may be able to make use of qualitative and quantitative analysis methods
on this data.


## Why should we maintain personal data science projects?

Why should we spend our limited and precious time doing personal data science?
As mentioned earlier, we have a competitive advantage here.
However, the case for performing personal data science is deeper than this.

"As knowledge workers,
our mood is one of the largest determinants of our productivity" (Tiago Forte.)
This is true whether we are doing work to better our own lives or for others.
Each of us is affected by our own moods more frequently than any other person.
Therefore, each of us bears the highest responsibility
for managing our own moods.

Sound and effective management,
at least according to the father of modern American management---
W. Edwards Demings, requires knowledge of both psychology and of variation
(i.e., statistics).
Essentially, everyone needs to be their own data scientist,
with subject matter expertise in psychology.

Of course, if we take up this role, benefits will come our way.
We'll gain increased self-knowledge
by paying more consistent attention to ourselves;
we'll be able to exercise greater self-control
through our increased self-knowledge;
and we'll be able to achieve greater quality of our own lives in the future---
we'll be better able to thrive on our own
as demand for therapists far outpaces the supply of therapists
(both in absolute number and in quality hours).

In addition to immediate and future benefits to our own lives,
we can help enable future benefits for other people.
If we are able to demonstrate useful personal data science projects
for those in our families and social circles,
then we can make helpful tools and distill useful stories for the public.

Finally, on a personal level,
if we make everything a data science project, then
- we gain immediate calm
  because we have familiarity in running such projects;
- we gain immediate clarity,
  in terms of what to do when as a reasonable starting point; and
- we gain greater courage from our history of long-term success
  despite adversity in such projects.


## How to get started?

Given these benefits, the immediate question is--how can we get started?
I believe the thing to do is to leverage the fact that "emotions are data."
As far as personal data science goes,
the most critical data science project to begin with is
collecting data on and understanding our emotions and moods.
The reason for this is that if we feel bad,
then our attempts to solve any other problem become more difficult.

To practically get started, I would focus on the basics.
Create a folder structure on our computer.
Let this folder house all of our data science projects,
and yes, there will be multiple.

A helpful structure for our overall folder could be the P.A.R.A. folder system.
That is, four sub-folders: projects, areas, resources, and archives.
Our various data science projects will live in their own repositories,
within one of these four sub-folders.
More on the P.A.R.A structure here.

Next, make a repository
for the data science project of managing one's moods and emotions.
In this repository, we're going to
track how we're feeling throughout the day and across days.
Some guidance on how to perform the emotion or mood tracking is described here.

An easy way to set up the repository is to use the cookiecutter folder template
that I set up for data science projects here.
We'll also want to use software for version controlling all of our files,
such as git for code and frequently changing files
and git-annex for media files.
This will get us to a state where we have a local home on our computer for our
work.

On a mental level, the goal will be to understand how our moods fluctuate,
and in relation to what.
From a practical perspective,
we'll want to use this knowledge
to regulate the moods and emotions we are experiencing,
so as to increase the characteristics of Self,
to give ourselves the greatest chance of achieving our goals.
In particular, we'll want to manage our emotions and moods
to support our health in all the ways we can:
physically, mentally, emotionally, socially, romantically, and financially.

To do so,
after we've made an emotion or moods repository,
make a note that lists all the problems that we can think of,
that either stem from or cause our emotional dysregulation.
This will overview the problems that we are dealing with---
i.e., the full-set of problems we'll be transforming
and that data science might be of use in reducing.

Likewise, it is useful to overview not just the lived set of transformations
to bring about, but also the digital transformations as well.
After the setup described so far,
we'll have a local but insecure folder
for all of our personal data science work.
We'll want to take additional steps
to secure our data both on our computer locally
as well as on external hardware and over the internet.
The full setup we'll use is illustrated in this diagram,
but we'll describe it in depth in future posts.

Young Tim,
if you make this turn towards
organizing everything in your life as a personal data science project,
then I think you'll be able to put yourself back in order again.
And what a fun ride it'll be.
Fear not, for you're well prepared for this:
more prepared than for any other thing we've done to date,
and I can't wait to what good it amounts to.

Till next time,
