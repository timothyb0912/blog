# Prep√°rate

## TLDR

- We want a life with long-term financial security
  and short-term financial freedoms.
- Working as a data scientist can meet both of these desires.
- However, this path is fraught with macro-economic,
  industry-wide, and personal difficulties.
- Succeeding in-spite of existing challenges
  will likely require accepting unpleasant social constraints.
- Moreover, we'll likely need "intense" time uses and planning.

Dear Young Tim,

Merry Christmas!
More than ever,
it's clear that the best presents we can give ourselves
are to meet our needs.
Two such needs stand out as greatly important:
- securing long-term financial security
- and providing for short-term financial freedoms.

Similar to many others,
we want to retire in the future,
while being secure in our ability to comfortably support ourselves.
Likewise, we want the freedom to comfortably take
shorter term sabbaticals.
Such breaks help us recover from unexpected hardships
or prepare for upcoming efforts.

In order to take sabbaticals or retire,
we find that we require overlapping and non-trivial resources.
For instance, we need to be able to stockpile investments
that can support us while not employed.
Further we require investments (financial or otherwise)
that are able to resist inflation or depreciation.
That is, our investments need to retain their usefulness over time.
Finally, we need the ability to leave (and return).
While less of an issue for final departures in retirement,
we are unlikely to take sabbaticals
if we cannot return to employment afterwards.
And to be clear,
without the ability to leave and later return,
it will be hard to enforce boundaries
that protect our quality of life while working.

On the surface,
working in the field of data science
seems to meet these lower-level requirements.
One is paid relatively well, and thus able to stockpile resources.
Many tech companies also offer stock-based compensation.
If wisely managed, such compensation can resist inflation
and appreciate over time.
Finally, [demand](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/math/data-scientists.htm)
for data scientists is currently higher than supply.
This surplus of opportunities eases the task of returning
after a sabbatical.

However, like any engineer planning to build a complex system,
we will benefit from carefully surveying
the grounds we are about to begin working in.
By identifying difficulties and problems before we begin (again),
we can better prepare ourselves to avoid or cope with these issues.

## Macro-realities

Let's start by working from the outermost context inwards.
We'll consider the private sector
because it has more data science positions
(and [higher pay](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2022/02/07/government-wage-growth-lags-private-sector-by-largest-margin-on-record))
as compared to the public sector.

Within private corporations,
pay increases are often best accessed by
[changing jobs](https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-workers-double-salaries-job-hopping-developers-great-resignation-2022-4)
in a booming economy.
Conversely, in economic downturns,
private sector layoffs are common.
For example, according to [layoffs.fyi](https://layoffs.fyi/),
technology companies have laid off
more than 150,000 workers in 2022.

The net result of these trends is that,
in both boom and bust economies,
we must be ready to switch private sector jobs.
Such job switching involves being ready for interviews,
and it also means maintaining a profile of public value-additions[^1].
Given the demand surplus described above,
these practices ensure that we (and our demonstrated value)
are not wholly bound to a single employer.
I.e., these practices provide the leaving ability
we desire from "short-term financial freedom."
