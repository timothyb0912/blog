# Prep√°rate

## TLDR

- We want a life with long-term financial security
  and short-term financial freedoms.
- Working as a data scientist can meet both of these desires.
- However, this path is fraught with macro-economic,
  industry-wide, and personal difficulties.
- Succeeding in-spite of existing challenges
  will likely require accepting unpleasant social constraints.
- Moreover, we'll likely need "intense" time uses and planning.

Dear Young Tim,

Merry Christmas!
More than ever,
it's clear that the best presents we can give ourselves
are to meet our needs.
Two such needs stand out as greatly important:
- securing long-term financial security
- and providing for short-term financial freedoms.

Similar to many others,
we want to retire in the future,
while being secure in our ability to comfortably support ourselves.
Likewise, we want the freedom to comfortably take
shorter term sabbaticals.
Such breaks help us recover from unexpected hardships
or prepare for upcoming efforts.

In order to take sabbaticals or retire,
we find that we require overlapping and non-trivial resources.
For instance, we need to be able to stockpile investments
that can support us while not employed.
Further we require investments (financial or otherwise)
that are able to resist inflation or depreciation.
That is, our investments need to retain their usefulness over time.
Finally, we need the ability to leave (and return).
While less of an issue for final departures in retirement,
we are unlikely to take sabbaticals
if we cannot return to employment afterwards.
And to be clear,
without the ability to leave and later return,
it will be hard to enforce boundaries
that protect our quality of life while working.

On the surface,
working in the field of data science
seems to meet these lower-level requirements.
One is paid relatively well, and thus able to stockpile resources.
Many tech companies also offer stock-based compensation.
If wisely managed, such compensation can resist inflation
and appreciate over time.
Finally, [demand](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/math/data-scientists.htm)
for data scientists is currently higher than supply.
This surplus of opportunities eases the task of returning
after a sabbatical.

However, like any engineer planning to build a complex system,
we will benefit from carefully surveying
the grounds we are about to begin working in.
By identifying difficulties and problems before we begin (again),
we can better prepare ourselves to avoid or cope with these issues.

## Macro-realities

Let's start by working from the outermost context inwards.
We'll consider the private sector
because it has more data science positions
(and [higher pay](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2022/02/07/government-wage-growth-lags-private-sector-by-largest-margin-on-record))
as compared to the public sector.

Within private corporations,
pay increases are often best accessed by
[changing jobs](https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-workers-double-salaries-job-hopping-developers-great-resignation-2022-4)
in a booming economy.
Conversely, in economic downturns,
private sector layoffs are common.
For example, according to [layoffs.fyi](https://layoffs.fyi/),
technology companies have laid off
more than 150,000 workers in 2022.

The net result of these trends is that,
in both boom and bust economies,
we must be ready to switch private sector jobs.
Such job switching involves being ready for interviews,
and it also means maintaining a profile of public value-additions[^1].
Given the demand surplus described above,
these practices ensure that we (and our demonstrated value)
are not wholly bound to a single employer.
I.e., these practices provide the leaving ability
we desire from "short-term financial freedom."


## Industry-realities

As noted above,
we want to maintain readiness for data science interviews.
Immediately, we're led to consider the question of
"how to maintain readiness?"
Or more specifically,
"what do we need to know,
in order to be ready for data science interviews and work?"
This question brings our attention one contextual level deeper,
from private corporations in general
to data science in particular.
We'll look at the realities of both
interviewing to get data scientist positions
and performing once in the role.


### Interviewing

The first thing to note about data science interviews
is that they are CHALLENGING.
Their difficulty stems both from their depth and their breadth.
In particular, data science interviews
require **extensive** preparation
in software engineering and in statistics.
This level of preparation is typically far beyond
what we learn in any one graduate program of study.

In software engineering,
we'll want to be intimately familiar with

- data structures,
- algorithms,
- computational complexity,
- graph traversal,
- search,
- sorting,
- dynamic programming,
- software testing
- and industry tools for "big data" handling.

This familiarity includes both [explicit knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explicit_knowledge)
as in "what is this"
and [tacit knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge)
as in having much experience in "how, why, and when to use this."
Such levels of familiarity demand study and practice,
especially since computer science wasn't
our primary area of study in school.
Indeed, this engineering focus for data scientists
has been noted by many others:
e.g., [here](https://www.yulingyao.com/blog/2021/job/)
and [here](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2022/12/08/the-cleantech-job-market-every-modeler-is-supposed-to-be-a-great-python-programmer/).

Similarly, in statistics,
we'll want to be intimately familiar with

- probability,
- summarization and analytics,
- experimentation and causal inference,
- and modeling, estimation, and assessment

As with software engineering,
we will be expected to be fluent in the details
and use of all areas above.
This means being ready to write code and math for all the above.
In school, we touched each of these statistical topics, in serial.
We also delved deeply into a subset of these topics simultaneously.
The difficulty of interviews is to internalize and make this
combined breadth and depth of knowledge available all at once.

Finally, we'll also need to be aware of the business terminology
and concerns for each company we're interviewing with.
Though terminology and specific concerns will change
with each company's domain,
a basic understanding of
[business fundamentals](https://towardsdatascience.com/basic-business-concepts-you-need-to-know-as-a-data-scientist-faeaaf5056f)
will also be tested.


### Performing

When considering on the job performance,
we face a parallel situation to interview preparation.
The core difference is that breadth is more important day-to-day,
whereas depth is only needed infrequently.

For example, business acumen is of regular use,
due to frequent meetings with cross-functional partners:
product managers, engineers, designers, business teams, etc.
In such meetings,
statistical details are rarely the focus of discussion.

Moreover, even when doing solo work,
most of our time may be spent gathering data
or building and maintaining pipelines
for models in production.
Here, we'll need to be something of a [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) polyglot
and an [ML-Ops](https://ml-ops.org/) master, simply due to job necessity.
This focus brings a demand
for software engineering best practices
that is unlikely to be assessed thoroughly in interviews
but is of great importance for easing our life in practice.
E.g. tons of data and software testing to prevent or catch errors.
Time will need to be spent learning these skills as well.

Finally, there will be immense demand for development speed.
As our time is money (a "downside" to high pay),
businesses rarely allow the long-term efforts common in academia.
Moreover, [most ideas fail](https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2021/11/04/sobering-truth/) in experiment.
There are many reasons for this,
but the outcome for businesses is a preference to "fail fast"
and therefore work fast as well.
Highly original model development or
sophisticated experiment design and analysis
will therefore be a professional exception, not the norm.
We'll want to maintain agility with the basics of many techniques,
and the ability to go deeper when necessary,
rather than only maintaining depth of knowledge in a few areas.


## Personal-realities

As detailed in the previous sections,
there is much to be learned to prepare for data science interviews
and work.
In all honesty,
the mountain of subjects concerns and intimidates us.
It is helpful here, to consider the final contextual level---ourselves.
What about our current position in life will complicate our efforts?

To start, we have many decades of experience
and professional corroboration
that we learn differently than our peers.
Not less well in outcome, but differently in process.
Indeed, [neurodivergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodiversity) is a thing.
We require much more repetition than many others,
and we require an atypically wide range of learning efforts.
All of this translates to increased efforts to gain proficiency
with an already ambitious number of topics.

Moreover, we approach this technical learning
with challenging mental health circumstances.
These challenges necessitate
our increased efforts in emotional regulation.
Of course, nothing is really free,
so the increased time spent on emotional regulation efforts
means less time available for other activities,
such as learning and studying.
Combined with the previous paragraph,
we see that we need to do more learning activities
with fewer time resources than if "all was well."

Finally, there is my typically unstated skin in the game.
By that, I mean the ramifications of being black.
At every company I've worked at as a data scientist,
I was always the first (or only) black data scientist.
We can endlessly discuss the reasons for this,
but nonetheless,
these realities motivate us toward "constant vigilance."
As noted by
distinguished engineer[^2] [Kelsey Hightower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Hightower):

> growing up, I was always taught I got to be twice as good.  
> That's a real thing for those that don't know, right.

> I believe, is I had to hedge against all the hidden obstacles.

My parents, like many other black parents in the United States,
always said the same thing.
These instructions and my experiences result in a feeling,
perhaps reflective of a silently biased reality,
that we must work extra hard
to get a seat at any table we want to eat at.
Like before,
such extra efforts exacerbate the issue
of needing to learn more with less time.
