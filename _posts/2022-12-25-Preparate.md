# Prep√°rate

## TLDR

- We want a life with long-term financial security
  and short-term financial freedoms.
- Working as a data scientist can meet both of these desires.
- However, this path is fraught with macro-economic,
  industry-wide, and personal difficulties.
- Succeeding in-spite of existing challenges
  will likely require accepting unpleasant social constraints.
- Moreover, we'll likely need "intense" time uses and planning.

Dear Young Tim,

Merry Christmas!
More than ever,
it's clear that the best presents we can give ourselves
are to meet our needs.
Two such needs stand out as greatly important:
securing long-term financial security
and providing for short-term financial freedoms.
Similar to many others,
we want to retire in the future,
while being able to comfortably support ourselves.
Likewise, we want to be able comfortably take
shorter term sabbaticals.
Such breaks help us recover from unexpected hardships
or prepare for upcoming efforts.
