# Question everything: effective thinking is effective communication.

Dear Young Tim,

Peter K. Gerlach---social worker, therapist,
is the first person to have notified me of the idea that
effective thinking is the same as effective communication.
In particular, effective thinking is effective communication amongst
differing sub-parts or subselves within you.
I know you've experienced the feeling of a part of you
wanting to stay up and continue on with your research, and
another part of you wanting to go to bed because it knows this will be best for
your long term health.
I know you know the conflict that arises when these parts of you don't agree.

Gerlach's thesis therefore represents an opportunity for us to improve
the way we facilitate dialogue between our conflicting inner parts.
This relates to our recent posts on coded communications.
It is an opportunity from us to move from a commanding relationship,
whereby one part of ourselves shuts down another part,
to a mutual coaching relationship whereby each part supports each other in what
they need or want to do.
Put another way, this is moving from a,
first you, then me, or vice versa, (in the best scenario)
to a harmonizing relationship where multiple parts can sing together at once,
yet sing together well.

This represents another way to conceptualize the goal of
therapeutic healing or coaching.
We wish to facilitate this harmony with your differing sub-parts and
each other, as well as with your actions.
This relation also connects directly to individuals we consider especially
clear critical thinkers such as Socrates,
since the Socratic method is all about questioning.
Here, we see the relation to coaching.
Coaches (like good teachers) supply one with suggestions and,
more importantly, questions that
help you discover a good path forward for yourself (as in the Socratic method).
A clear direction for bettering yourself and putting yourself back together
is learning to ask yourself appropriate questions
to facilitate the needed dialogue between your conflicting  parts.

Note that such a question-asking agenda is related to
cognitive behavioral therapy.
There, occurrences of your thoughts/feelings/actions that are undesirable,
are to be met with a series of questions.
For instance,
- what is the activating event that led to this thought/feeling/action?
- what is the specific belief that I hold related to this thought/feeling/action?
- what are the physical and emotional consequences of this belief?
- what are various ways of disputing this belief with evidence?
  What further questions are to be asked to make sure my thinking is sound
  and thorough?

Such a series of questions helps change and clarify your thinking.
The socratic method in general takes us a step further than our previous post.
We want to question not just the process, but all of our thoughts.
We want to use such questioning to promote better dialogue and understanding
between otherwise conflicting parts, and eventually,
between conflicting individuals.
The hope is that better thinking and understanding in oneself will translate
into your being better able to connect with others,
and to your being better being able question them,
to promote a similarly deep level of understanding between each other.
Good luck and take care!
