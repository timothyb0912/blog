# Causal graphs and principles for designing your life's systems

Dear Young Tim,

In life, you will inevitably design and debug systems.
Think of the physical systems you interact with.
Your cardiovascular, dental, immune, and transportation systems.
Think of the procedural systems you interact with.
Your personal research system, your personal finance system,
your personal software system, your business operational system.

Trust, time is a short man.
If you want to see far,
then it is in your best interest to learn from others.
To stand on the shoulders of giants.
In other words, read!
Learn from the experiences of others.

What I wish I told you earlier is that
debugging is a three step process.

## Takeaways

First, you respond to the immediate negative outcome.

Second, you modify your procedures and decision-making processes
so this particular issue does not happen again.

Third, you address the root causes about oneself and about one's
organization so this problem is less likely to recur in the
future.

How did I get to these conclusions?
Through books, a causal graphical approach,
a general systems view and causal graph,
and through gleaned principles of debugging.

Right. Let me unpack that...

## Books
First, the books.
I read [Principles](https://www.principles.com/) and [Work the System](https://www.workthesystem.com/).

## Perspective
While reading, I made use of the following key idea from [Michael Margolis](http://et.worldeconomicsassociation.org/files/WEA-ET-6-1-Margolis.pdf).

> Graphing causal models, while reading ~~econometric papers~~ can make it easy
> to understand assumptions that are vague in prose
> and to isolate those assumptions that are crucial to believe the main causal
> claims [strikethrough by Timothy]

With that perspective, I approached these two books as causal graphical novels,
rather than as traditional books.

## Graphs
The first graph that stood out to me was the following.

Dalio wrote:
> So, the quality of our lives depends on the quality of the decisions we make.
> We literally make millions of decisions that add up
> to the consequences that are our lives. (p. 16)

<!-- Put image of decisions to outcomes -->

Next, I saw Carpenter write about a life of linear systems.
Specifically, he said

> Linear: For our purposes, this is how most systems execute themselves,
> in a 1-2-3 stepped progression
> Yes, there are always minor external and internal variables [...].
> But here in the real world, we are streamlining things so events can be understood and manipulated. (p. 10)

<!-- Put image of arrow of time to 1 to 2 -->

Putting the two together, I see the sequence of decisions AS
the system from Carpenter or the "machine" from Dalio.

That's the first milestone.

I am in charge of managing my life, aka the sequence of decisions I make, that,
in combination with all the circumstance of life,
result in the outcomes that I receive.

Next, what happens when that system produces outcomes that I don't like?
How should I debug?

Dalio writes that,

> It is important to distinguish root causes from proximate causes. (Principles, p.31)

<!-- See annotated causal graph with debugging path from d1 root to d2 proximate to outcome -->

> Proximate causes typically are
> the actions or lack of actions that lead to problems—
> e.g., “I missed the train because
> I didn’t check the train schedule.” (Principles, p.31)

<!-- Put that quote in a word bubble over the D2 node -->

> Root causes are the deeper reasons
> behind the proximate cause:
> “I didn’t check the schedule
> because I am forgetful”—a root cause. (Principles, p.31)

<!--  Put that quote in a word bubble near the D2 node -->

From Dalio we see that debugging or responding to a system
that is not producing desirable outcomes has at least two steps.
We change how we make our decisions to change our proximate causes.
We change how we are to change our root causes.

Carpenter writes that,

> [...] a problem is [...] a wake-up call.
> This means that once the manager corrects the immediate negative effects,
> there is a second step.
> It is this second step that is key:
> The problem’s cause is traced to the errant subsystem,
> which is then modified so that the problem doesn’t happen again.
> --Work the System

Here we see the emphasis placed on a different section of our graph.

<!-- Put graph with colored edges and nodes-->

From Carpenter, we see that when debugging and responding to a system
that is not producing desirable outcomes,
we must first respond to the immediate negative outcome,
and then we need to fix the subsystem (the decisions in D1 and D2)
"so the problem doesn't happen again."

Putting it together, we see that debugging is a three step process.
Address the immediate ramifications of the undesired outcome.
Change the way you make decisions so that we change our proximate causes.
Change the way you are as a person so you change your root causes.

That Young Tim, is what I wish I told you many years ago.

  - <img src="https://static.thenounproject.com/png/2110307-200.png" style="height: 100px, border: none;"></img> dental
  - <img src="https://static.thenounproject.com/png/2909354-200.png" style="height: 100px, border: none;"></img> immune
  - <img src="https://static.thenounproject.com/png/19265-200.png" style="height: 100px, border: none;"></img> transportation
  (e.g. bicycle, car)
- Procedural systems:
  - <img src="https://static.thenounproject.com/png/2992113-200.png" style="height: 100px, border: none;"></img> personal research system
  - <img src="https://static.thenounproject.com/png/1129376-200.png" style="height: 100px, border: none;"></img> personal finance system
  - <img src="https://static.thenounproject.com/png/1849633-200.png" style="height: 100px, border: none;"></img> personal software systems
  - <img src="https://static.thenounproject.com/png/2973420-200.png" style="height: 100px, border: none;"></img> business operational systems

Show the above systems by way of
a two column design.
One column for physical and the other for procedural systems.
For each column, arrange the icons in a circle around their topic.

## Learn from others

Two column design again.
Stand on the shoulders of giants in one column.

## Key reading idea

> Graphing causal models while reading ~~econometric~~c papers can make it easy to understand assumptions
that are vague in prose and to isolate those assumptions that are crucial to believe the main causal claims

"Graphs as a tool for the close reading of econometrics" by Michael Margolis ([2015](https://ekum.pw/zpia.pdf))

## Graphic novels -> causal graphical novels?

> Graphing causal models while reading ~econometric papers~ can make it easy to understand assumptions
that are vague in prose and to isolate those assumptions that are crucial to believe the main causal claims [edits by Timothy].

"Graphs as a tool for the close reading of econometrics" by Michael Margolis ([2015](https://ekum.pw/zpia.pdf))

## Principles and decisions

> So, the quality of our lives depends on the quality of the decisions we make. We literally make millions of decisions that add up to the consequences that are our lives. (p. 16)

Just show decision nodes, each affecting outcome.
Each decision node coming from a stick figure me.

---

## Life of linear systems

> Linear: For our purposes, this is how most systems execute themselves, in a 1-2-3 stepped progression. Yes, there are always minor external and internal variables [...]. But here in the real world, we are streamlining things so events can be understood and manipulated. (p. 10)

Show 1 -> 2 -> 3.

---

## My elaboration and combination

Insert picture from notebook or something similar.
Note that the sequence of decisions / actions IS the "system" from Sam Carpenter or the "machine" from Ray Dalio.

---

## Principled debugging

At the top of slide:
> It is important to distinguish root causes from proximate causes. (Principles, p.31)


Annotated causal graph from the previous slide.
Show the debugging path from person to D2, to D3 to outcome in a highlilghted color.

Above the decision nodes:
> Proximate causes typically are the actions or lack of actions that lead to problems—e.g., “I missed the train because I didn’t check the train schedule.” (Principles, p.31)

Near the stick figure person:
> Root causes are the deeper reasons behind the proximate cause: “I didn’t check the schedule because I am forgetful”—a root cause. (Principles, p.31)

Note emphasis is on responding at root cause level, presumably so this type of issue is less likely to recur.

---

## Systems management / rehabilitation

> [...] a problem is [...] a wake-up call. This means that once the manager corrects the immediate negative effects, there is a second step. It is this second step that is key: **The problem’s cause is traced to the errant subsystem, which is then modified** so that the problem doesn’t happen again. --Work the System

Highlight the debug path to the decision nodes and on the outcome itself.
Emphasis is on first responding to the immediate negative outcome, then fix the procedures / decision-making process so this particular issue doesn't happen again.

---

## Systems management / rehabilitation

> Identifying the real root causes of your problems is essential because you can eliminate your problems only by removing their root causes. (Principles, p.31)

After responding to the immediate issue,
and after changing one's system of decisions and actions to achieve better outcomes,
we must address our root causes **by changing ourselves** so we can upkeep our new system,
and so we minimize our chance of suffering from our old habits and from similar problems.

---

## Takeaways for debugging
(AKA problem-driven life-design)

Show combined image and 3 step process:
1. respond to immediate negative outcome
2. Modify procedures and decision-making processes so this particular issue does not happen again.
3. Address the root causes about oneself and one's organization so this type of problem is less-likely to recur in the future.
