# Time Budgets

%% Why? %%
%% Life is squandered without managing time. %%
%% "But if one cannot arrange that an income of 24 hours a day %%
%% shall exactly cover all proper items of expenditure, %%
%% one does muddle one's life definitely. %%
%% The supply of time, %%
%% though gloriously regular, %%
%% is cruelly restricted." %%
%% Excerpt From: Arnold Bennett. “How to Live on 24 Hours a Day.” %%

## Defining amazing

Dear Young Tim,

> What would amazing look like?

In [Growing Pains](https://timothyb0912.github.io/blog/practice/2022/08/31/Growing-Pains.html#lifestyle-acceptance-tests)
we noted the importance of
"starting with clear statements of what outcomes and functionality 
we want from our life’s systems."
As far as life systems go, in [More Choices, Faster](https://timothyb0912.github.io/blog/reading/2021/03/31/More-choices-faster.html#tactics),
we noted that our time management system
is of utmost importance,
because it represents how we use our scarcest resource---
our time.

Putting these thoughts together,
a natural question is
what outcomes do we want from our time management system?
Or, more practically,
how do we want to spend our time?
**What would our time allocation look like in an amazing week?**

As stated rather gravely in the [Bible](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2029:18&version=KJV),
"where there is no vision, the people perish."
Though perhaps hyperbole,
it is difficult to increase our number of amazing weeks per year,
if we are not clear about what an amazing week looks like.
Accordingly, to start us and keep us on a path
that eventually matches our realities with our dreams,
we'll want to prioritize sketching
an achievable vision of an ideal week.


## Weekly canvas

Assuming we make it through the next seven days,
we will have 168 hours to work with.
This is the extent of our weekly canvas,
on which our time-use choices
express our constraints and our values.
Though the hours may sound plentiful,
we have almost always wanted to do more than we have time for,
and this mismatch is growing as we age.
As such, it behooves us to carefully budget our time,
so that we can invest our time in what we care for,
and so we can be prepared for the consequences of the
investments we did NOT make.


## Drawing activities

We can start budgeting time for an ideal week
by diagramming and listing all the main activities
we may want or need to spend our time on.
A combination of efforts may be most useful for creating this list.
For instance, we can draw from the activity categories
we've spent time on at various points in our past.
Additionally,
we can include the activity categories we want to spend time on, even if we have not done so regularly before.
Finally, we want to include whatever activities are required
in order to meet our various needs.

We found this exercise illuminating,
even before allocating time to the activities.
First, after arriving at a satisfyingly exhaustive list
of activity categories,
we listed 42 different categories.
This sheer number of things we want to do is so great
that if we are not explicitly and externally managing these activities,
then we can understand why our general state
produces anxiety and overwhelm.

Secondly, the list was a lens through which we could view our life. We clearly saw that we had never consistently engaged
in all our desired activities simultaneously.
Covering all our bases,
i.e. avoiding neglect of important life systems,
did not happen spontaneously.
To pay attention to all our life systems, all the time,
we will likely need concerted effort.
Concerted effort may also be needed
if we wish to sustainably rotate our attention between systems
without any critical failures happening
in the unattended parts of our life.


## Constraint optimization

With a list of desired activity categories,
we can now consider constraints to be honored
when allocating time across categories.
For instance,
we may want a minimum amount of time for specific activities.
E.g., we may want at least 7 hours of sleep per night.
Alternatively,
we may want a minimum amount of time for any scheduled activity.
Further, some activities may be constrained in the days or order
in which they are are completed.
And of course, we want to respect the constraint
that we only have 168 hours to allocate per week.

Determining if a given scheduling problem and its constraints
have a feasible solution is part of the field of
[constraint programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_programming)
or [constraint optimization](https://developers.google.com/optimization/cp/).
For now, we'll start with generating time budgets manually,
but in the future,
we'll want to experiment with perhaps faster
and more formal approaches to solving these problems.

So, how much time, across days of a week, per activity?
To generate time allocations,
we can consider at least two complementary approaches.
First, we might start from an allocation in our past,
and iteratively make tradeoffs that respect our constraints
while subjectively becoming more desirable.

Conversely, we can start from an allocation of time that we consider maximally appealing but perhaps unrealistic.
For example, we might allocate more than 168 hours per week.
Then, we can progressively edit the appealing allocation
to its closest constraint-satisfying allocation
according to some distance metric.
Do not worry if that metric is an initially unspecified "gut feeling"
about what is most similar to the maximally appealing allocation.
We all have to start somewhere!


## What's missing

Our above exercises in constraint optimization
will provide us with weekly time budgets
that are "feasibly ideal."
They may not be all we want,
but they hopefully represent the best tradeoffs we can imagine.
Looking at these aspirational budgets can teach us many lessons.

For instance, we might ask ourselves what needs are NOT met,
even in our "ideal" time allocations?
That is, what activity categories do we not allocate time to?
And, of course, how can we prevent life system failure despite
a lack of time investment in this area?

We can also ask, how do our current allocations of time
differ from our ideal allocations?
What activities can we feasibly do less of
to reach our ideal allocations?
What activities can we feasibly do more of?

Finally, we might ask,
what constraints, if relaxed,
would enable ideal allocations
that are exciting as opposed to just "the best we can do?"
Once we identify these desired constraint relaxations,
they can serve as goals for us to work towards.
We may have to endure unpleasant time allocations short-term,
but enduring may be easier
if we are working to relax specific constraints
that we know will unlock amazing weeks in our future.
