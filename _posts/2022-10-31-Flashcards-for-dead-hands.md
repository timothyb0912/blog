# Flashcards for dead hands

%% See deadhand image %%

## Intrusive memories

Dear Young Tim,

> Why can't you leave the past in the past?

Over time, this question will bring much irony to our life.
When these words first slammed into our eardrums
like a pot thundering to the floor,
we rejected them outright.
Immediately, we rejected the premise we believed the question was based on.
After all, knowledge is power, right?
Why would we want to forget what we know of the past?
We then rejected the question itself as a distraction,
opting to "delve deeper" and focus on its motivating problems.

While not incorrect, the ironies would come months later,
after the motivating problems were indeed firmly placed in our past.
First there was the loss of appetite and pounds.
One pound, two pounds, ten pounds, and more.
For some time, flashbacks of painful past experiences would rob us of
preparatory time and desire to eat.
Not to be a "Debbie Downer" forever,
we eventually upgraded to more positive problems.
Here, pleasant memories would greet us upon waking
and usher us daily onto the dance floor
for an intensely dysregulating waltz of
happy -> sad -> angry, happy -> sad -> angry.
So, despite our initial reactions
and for different though related reasons,
we again asked "why can't we leave the past in the past?"

Merriam-Webster [defines](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dead%20hand) a "dead hand"
as "the oppressive influence of the past."
Whether pleasant or unpleasant,
[intrusive memories](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5938103/pdf/nihms915082.pdf)
have served as nature's faithful dead hands in our life.
These intruding memories may be thought of on a linear spectrum,
with traumatic (i.e. intensely unpleasant) memories on one end
and addictive (i.e. intensely pleasant) memories on the other end.
Both ends lead to dysfunction, though via differing mechanisms.


## Unprocessed memories

One therapy modality that has proven useful in treating
problems related to intrusive thoughts is EMDR.
EMDR has shown benefits in randomized controlled trials,
for both traumatized individuals (as with PTSD)
and individuals with addictions.
Underlying the mechanisms of benefit in both situations
is a common understanding that "unprocessed" memories
lead to both types of intrusive memories and that accompanying sensations
then drive extreme beliefs and behaviors.
As [put](https://connect.springerpub.com/content/sgremdr/2/4/315.abstract)
by Solomon and Shapiro (creator of EMDR),

> Pathology is viewed as unprocessed memories, [...] (p. 318).

Similarly, other EMDR researchers would later [note](https://www.imagetransformationtherapy.org/traumatology-article-pdf.pdf)

> it is not the positive or negative quality of the feelings that is important
> in creating a state-dependent memory
> but the intensity of the feelings.

In both situations,
the explanation of unprocessed memories
begs the questions of what is a processed memory
and how can one process memories?

As [described](https://www.traumahealingforall.com/blog/how-to-tell-if-a-memory-needs-to-be-processed-aka-can-emdr-help-with-this) by EMDR therapist Laura Paton,

> A processed memory will generally be something

> and when you do,
> it doesn't have any emotional charge associated with it,
> and you feel no need to bring it up regularly
> or think about it for a prolonged time.

According to Solomon and Shapiro ([p. 320](https://connect.springerpub.com/content/sgremdr/2/4/315.abstract)),
one key mechanism in processing memories is
associating otherwise disjointed fragments of memory.
Specifically, (re)processing a memory involves associating:
- the intrusive memory 'image'
- extreme beliefs related to the memory
- functional beliefs you instead wish to relate to the memory
- the current emotions related to the memory
- the current physical sensation related to the memory

These associations are thought to facilitate
"[memory reconsolidation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982213007719),"
wherein the information and form of the information accessed with
a memory is updated.
For example, we might update
emotion(s) and emotional strength of the memories,
beliefs based on the memory,
and experienced sensations (or the lack thereof).

As [described](https://pbspamericaconnect.org/resources/Documents/Ecker%20et%20al.%20-%20Primer%20on%20memory%20reconsolidation.pdf)
by Ecker et al (pp. 86 - 87),
memory reconsolidation roughly happens by

- accessing the disturbing memory
  and its explicitly associated beliefs, emotions, and sensations
- providing an alternative, less disturbing experience alongside the memory
  (such as with bilateral stimulation in EMDR desensitization phases)
- associating new, desired beliefs with the accessed, disturbing memory

This memory reconsolidation process also lies at the root of how
the Internal Family Systems model of therapy works,
as pointed out by neuroscientist Dr. Frank Anderson
in "[Transcending Trauma](https://www.amazon.com/Transcending-Trauma-Healing-Complex-Internal/dp/B09BD7D6C7/):
Healing Complex PTSD with Internal Family Systems Therapy"
(ch. 24, \#The Science Behind The Healing).
This connection offers us guidance for synergistically combining
some of our pre-existing efforts
for emotional regulation and memory management.
