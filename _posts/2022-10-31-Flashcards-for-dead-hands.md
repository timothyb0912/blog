# Flashcards for dead hands

<!-- %% See deadhand image %% -->

## Intrusive memories

Dear Young Tim,

> Why can't you leave the past in the past?

Over time, this question will bring much irony to our life.
When these words first slammed into our eardrums
like a pot thundering to the floor,
we rejected them outright.
Immediately,
we rejected the premise we believed the question was based on.
After all, knowledge is power, right?
Why would we want to forget what we know of the past?
We then rejected the question itself as a distraction.
Instead, we opted to "delve deeper"
by focusing on the question's motivating problems.

While not incorrect, the ironies would come months later,
after the motivating problems were indeed firmly placed in our past.
First there was the loss of appetite and pounds.
One pound, two pounds, ten pounds, and more.
For some time, flashbacks of painful past experiences would rob us of
preparatory time and desire to eat.
Not to be a "Debbie Downer" forever,
we eventually upgraded to more positive problems.
Here, pleasant memories would greet us upon waking
and usher us daily onto the dance floor
for an intensely dysregulating waltz of
happy -> sad -> angry, happy -> sad -> angry.
So, despite our initial reactions
and for different though related reasons,
we again asked "why can't we leave the past in the past?"

Merriam-Webster [defines](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dead%20hand) a "dead hand"
as "the oppressive influence of the past."
Whether pleasant or unpleasant,
[intrusive memories](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5938103/pdf/nihms915082.pdf)
have served as nature's faithful dead hands in our life.
These intruding memories may be thought of on a linear spectrum,
with traumatic (i.e. intensely unpleasant) memories on one end
and appetitive or addictive (i.e. intensely pleasant) memories
on the other end.
Both ends lead to dysfunction, though via differing mechanisms.


## Unprocessed memories

One therapy modality that has proven useful in treating
problems related to intrusive memories is EMDR.
EMDR has shown benefits in randomized controlled trials,
for both [traumatized](https://connect.springerpub.com/content/sgremdr/13/4/261.abstract) individuals (as with PTSD)
and individuals with [addictions](https://connect.springerpub.com/content/sgremdr/2/3/170.abstract).
Underlying the mechanisms of benefit in both situations
is a common understanding
that "unprocessed" memories lead to both types of intrusive memories. The sensations accompanying the intrusions
then drive extreme emotions, beliefs, and behaviors.
As [put](https://connect.springerpub.com/content/sgremdr/2/4/315.abstract)
by Solomon and Shapiro (creator of EMDR),

> Problems arise when an experience is inadequately processed.  
> Shapiroâ€™s AIP [Adaptive Information Processing] model
> (1995, 2001, 2006)  
> posits that a particularly distressing incident
> may become stored in state-specific form,  
> meaning frozen in time in its own neural network,  
> unable to connect with other memory networks
> that hold adaptive information.  
> She hypothesizes that when a memory is encoded in  
> excitatory, distressing, state-specific form,  
> the original perceptions
> can continue to be triggered  
> by a variety of internal and external stimuli,  
> resulting in inappropriate emotional, cognitive, and behavioral reactions,  
> as well as overt symptoms
> (e.g., high anxiety, nightmares, intrusive thoughts) (p. 316).  
> [...]  
> Pathology is viewed as unprocessed memories, [...] (p. 318).

Similarly, other EMDR researchers would later [note](https://www.imagetransformationtherapy.org/traumatology-article-pdf.pdf)

> it is not the positive or negative quality of the feelings that is important
> in creating a state-dependent memory
> but the intensity of the feelings.

In both situations,
the explanation of unprocessed memories
begs the questions of what is a processed memory
and how can one process memories?

As [described](https://www.traumahealingforall.com/blog/how-to-tell-if-a-memory-needs-to-be-processed-aka-can-emdr-help-with-this) by EMDR therapist Laura Paton,

> A processed memory will generally be something
> that you know has happened,  
> don't regularly think about,
> and when you do,  
> it doesn't have any emotional charge associated with it,  
> and you feel no need to bring it up regularly  
> or think about it for a prolonged time.

According to Solomon and Shapiro ([p. 320](https://connect.springerpub.com/content/sgremdr/2/4/315.abstract)),
one key mechanism in processing memories is
associating otherwise disjointed fragments of memory.
Specifically, (re)processing a memory involves associating:
- the intrusive memory 'image'
- extreme beliefs related to the memory
- functional beliefs you instead wish to relate to the memory
- the current emotions related to the memory
- the current physical sensation related to the memory

These associations are thought to facilitate
"[memory reconsolidation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982213007719),"
wherein the information and form of the information accessed with
a memory is updated.
For example, we might update
emotion(s) and emotional strength of the memories,
beliefs based on the memory,
and experienced sensations (or the lack thereof).

As [described](https://pbspamericaconnect.org/resources/Documents/Ecker%20et%20al.%20-%20Primer%20on%20memory%20reconsolidation.pdf)
by Ecker et al (p. 89),
memory reconsolidation roughly happens by

- accessing the disturbing memory
  and its explicitly associated beliefs, emotions, and sensations
- providing an alternative, less disturbing experience alongside the memory
  (such as with bilateral stimulation in EMDR desensitization phases)
- associating new, desired beliefs with the accessed, disturbing memory

This memory reconsolidation process also lies at the root of how
the Internal Family Systems (IFS) model of therapy works,
as pointed out by neuroscientist Dr. Frank Anderson
in "[Transcending Trauma](https://www.amazon.com/Transcending-Trauma-Healing-Complex-Internal/dp/B09BD7D6C7/):
Healing Complex PTSD with Internal Family Systems Therapy"
(ch. 24, \#The Science Behind The Healing).
This connection offers us guidance for synergistically combining
some of our pre-existing efforts
in emotional regulation and memory management.
We find that such combination offers increased hope of
efficient and consistent progress
towards memory reconsolidation
and freedom from intrusive memories.


## Memory management


### What and why

We use the term memory management (with people)
to refer to the control and directing of
what we remember and how we remember it.
For example, practices like making and using notes and flashcards
are two explicit memory management techniques.
In previous posts,
we've recommended these practices for numerous reasons, including:

- remembering [facts](https://timothyb0912.github.io/blog/philosophy/2020/12/24/Do-Over.html#be-rigorous-and-reproducible)
  and [thoughts](https://timothyb0912.github.io/blog/practice/2021/04/30/Journal-systematically.html)
  that we consider important
- remembering our [organization](https://timothyb0912.github.io/blog/psychology/practice/2022/04/30/Graph-Heavy.html)
  of important facts and thoughts
- associating images and [sensations](https://timothyb0912.github.io/blog/psychology/practice/2022/06/21/Yoga-and-kinesthetic-thinking.html) with memory of facts
  (e.g. associating physical sensations to names of yoga poses)
- and [streamlining](https://timothyb0912.github.io/blog/practice/2022/07/31/Digestion-before-expression.html)
  our efforts to produce and remember new thoughts

Ultimately, we manage our memory
to improve critical parts of our life.
Because whether or not we reconsolidate our intrusive memories
directly impacts our current and future emotional regulation
(i.e. a critical part of our life),
**intrusive memories and the actions we take on them
are automatically critical components
in our memory management efforts**.
We therefore stand to greatly benefit
from explicitly noting, acting upon, and strengthening
the connection between memory management and emotional regulation.
We'll start by considering
our practices and perspectives of emotional regulation
and how those impact our memory management.
Then, we'll look at what emotional regulation benefits we can glean
from our memory management practices and perspectives.


### Internal Family Systems

In [previous posts](https://timothyb0912.github.io/blog/psychology/2022/05/31/Emotional-leveraging.html) we've written about using IFS
techniques for and perspectives on emotional regulation.
These perspectives provide a window
through which we can view intrusive memories---
a view that is complementary to that of Shapiro's AIP model.
The IFS view of intrusive memories
then informs our memory management stance towards the intrusions.

Similarly, memory reconsolidation and the AIP model
provide a complementary view of IFS'
unburdening process.
In this case, the memory reconsolidation view of
the IFS unburdening process
suggests explicit points for beneficial
memory management interventions.


#### Views

First, intrusive memories show up as both "burdens" and as "trailheads"
in Internal Family Systems.
For instance, as described by [Bonnie Weiss](https://ifs-institute.com/practitioners/all/13712)
(a therapist and author, certified in both EMDR and IFS),

> a burden is an extreme feeling,
> **memory** [emphasis added],
> energy or belief about oneself or about the world
> that a part has taken on as a result of childhood trauma,
> a specific incident, a relationship, or another painful situation.
> The burden is not natural to the part
> and therefore can be released.  
> ---[Self-Therapy Workbook](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IJY7F7A):
> An Exercise Book For The IFS Process
> (p. 107)

From this definition,
a logical next step is to use the IFS "unburdening process"
to release the burdens, i.e. the intrusive memories.
As suggested by its name,
the unburdening process focuses on "getting rid of something."
However, despite wishing for a fast jettison,
unburdening is actually a long journey.
It begins with
making contact with the parts of our mind holding the burdens.
We make contact by exploring "trailheads."

Weiss writes that

> A *trailhead* is an experience or difficulty in your life
> that will lead to interesting parts if you follow it.
> It can be a situation or person that you react to,
> an emotional or bodily experience,
> a pattern of behavior or thinking,
> a dream, or anything else that indicates
> one or more parts to explore.
> IFS calls it a trailhead
> because it is the beginning of a trail that can lead to healing.  
> ---[Self-Therapy Workbook](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IJY7F7A) (p. 17)

From here, we note a duality in our intrusive memories.
Certainly, the intrusions are burdens to be released.
However, they are also trailheads to be explored,
rather than avoided or suppressed.
IFS's trailhead terminology
highlights the need for investigating intrusive memories
in the reconsolidation process.
This investigative focus balances
the negative judgement connoted by terms such as
"intrusive memory", "burden," "pathology," etc.
The negative connotations of such words and concepts
may increase the likelihood one seeks relief
by intuitively staying away from the intrusive memories
rather than examining them explicitly,
with care and compassion.

Accordingly, in the long-term,
we won't chronically respond to intrusive memories
with "just get over it" or "stop thinking about that."
To "get over" intrusive memories of our past,
i.e. to finally "leave the past in the past,"
we **want to** explore these memories.
Specifically, we want  to explore them
in ways that result in memory reconsolidation.
Some such ways include IFS' unburdening process,
EMDR's phased approach, etc.


#### Brews

Above, we noted that memory reconsolidation
has three core steps,
described in shorthand as
memory access,
memory "mismatch",
memory association.
To enable these three steps,
there are preparatory stages
to gather needed information
(Ecker et al., [pp. 90 - 91](https://pbspamericaconnect.org/resources/Documents/Ecker%20et%20al.%20-%20Primer%20on%20memory%20reconsolidation.pdf)).
For example, what's the memory,
what's a less disturbing experience,
and what are the desired, new associations?
This is where IFS' unburdening recipe comes in.
The unburdening process incrementally takes one
through the memory reconsolidation steps,
surfacing the information needed to progress through the steps
in one extended sitting.

The information from the unburdening process steps
is naturally suited for memory management,
e.g. for notes and flashcards.
In particular, the sheer amount of information
motivates explicit management,
if only to prevent slowdowns from information overwhelm.
Functionally,
we want to remember and have access to all of this information
at will and in quick succession,
for memory reconsolidation.

As informed by the discussion in
"[Transcending Trauma](https://www.amazon.com/Transcending-Trauma-Healing-Complex-Internal/dp/B09BD7D6C7/)
(ch. 24, \#The Science Behind The Healing),
the information we'll want to capture is as follows.
When we use IFS' [6F's](https://www.therapywithalessio.com/articles/the-6-fs-in-ifs-the-6-steps-to-get-to-know-our-protectors) to begin exploring a given intrusive memory,
we want to collect
the full range of symptoms that arises with memory access.
I.e., the full range of activated parts of mind
and their beliefs, emotions, sensations, and actions.
Then, we want to capture and organize
the details of the intrusive memory
as recalled in one or more rounds of IFS' [witnessing](https://integralguide.com/50+Permanent+Notes/%F0%9F%92%A1+Terms/Internal+Family+Systems+Therapy/%F0%9F%92%A1+Witnessing).

With the ability to re-access the memory,
we'll next want information that will allow us
to simultaneously provide an alternate, less disturbing experience.
IFS supplies this information through its
imaginative, [do-over](https://integralguide.com/50+Permanent+Notes/%F0%9F%92%A1+Terms/Internal+Family+Systems+Therapy/%F0%9F%92%A1+Witnessing#Do-Over)
part of reparenting.
As before, we'll want to store such information,
so we can later access it on-demand.
The do-over provides the mismatch experience
that disconnects the intrusive memory
from its original, burdensome reactions.
Once disconnected,
the intrusive memory is free to be associated
with desired, "adaptive information."

Finally, reconsolidation needs
new, 'disconfirming [experiential] knowledge'
to associate with the original intrusive memory.
These new learnings are provided by the
IFS steps of

- reparenting
  where, in the present,
  we assess and decide how to meet the needs of
  the parts of us that are activated by the intrusive memory
- [retrieval](https://integralguide.com/50+Permanent+Notes/%F0%9F%92%A1+Terms/Internal+Family+Systems+Therapy/%F0%9F%92%A1+Retrieval)
  where we can update and confront outdated beliefs,
  i.e. beliefs that no longer benefit us
- [invitation](https://integralguide.com/50+Permanent+Notes/%F0%9F%92%A1+Terms/Internal+Family+Systems+Therapy/%F0%9F%92%A1+Invitation)
  where we link new emotions with the intrusive memory
  (via association with our parts of mind
  activated by the intrusive memory)
- [integration](https://integralguide.com/50+Permanent+Notes/%F0%9F%92%A1+Terms/Internal+Family+Systems+Therapy/%F0%9F%92%A1+Integration)
  where we choose new beliefs and behaviors to associate
  with the various parts of our mind activated by the intrusive memory

In all such steps,
the particular mental scenes,
associated sensations,
and emotions
are information that we want to actively manage in our memory.
Again, such management may be
external as with notes
as well as internal through tools such as flashcards.

At this point,
we have all of the information needed for
the memory reconsolidation process
and for IFS' celebratory [unloading](https://integralguide.com/50+Permanent+Notes/%F0%9F%92%A1+Terms/Internal+Family+Systems+Therapy/%F0%9F%92%A1+Unburdening).
Afterwards, the only remaining tasks
are to [follow-up](https://web.archive.org/web/20211102161123/https://personal-growth-programs.com/required-unburdening-succeed/)
on the unburdening
and to verify that one's symptoms have disappeared.

As described in
[Transcending Trauma](https://www.amazon.com/Transcending-Trauma-Healing-Complex-Internal/dp/B09BD7D6C7/)
(ch. 24, \#The Post-Unburdening Process)

This follow-up process is most closely related to
existing aspects of our memory management practices,
so we'll turn our attention there next.


### Flashcards


#### Spaced-repetition

In managing our memory,
we are crucially concerned with
reinforcing and ensuring function
of the neural networks that allow access
to particular memories and learnings.
Our key practice for memory reinforcement is [spaced-repetition](https://ncase.me/remember/).
This technique is the raison d'Ãªtre we've recommended
using flashcards with [anki](https://ankiweb.net/about)---
a program that uses spaced repetition to schedule flashcard review.
This is one of the most effective methods known
for maintaining associations in memory over time.

Here, we can directly
apply spaced repetition by creating flashcards for the
scenes, sensations, emotions, and beliefs
from our unburdening and memory consolidation process.
Such a practice is intensive at first
(as with daily check-ins for a month post-unburdening),
but long-term maintenance of
healing and freedom from intrusive memories
seems to be a fair-trade.


#### Titration

Beyond the spaced follow-up to our reconsolidation efforts,
other common memory management techniques
also promote beneficial emotional regulation practices.
For instance,
consider the "[20 rules](https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm)
of formulating knowledge in learning."
This is an iconic set of guidelines for using flashcards
to manage one's memory.
Here, emphasis is placed on
minimizing the amount of information per flashcard and,
in conjunction, using many atomic flashcards
to collectively represent complex information.
This practice ensures that when accessing the intrusive memory
and information related to it,
we operate in small increments,
each of which is less likely to cause emotional dysregulation
than the original intrusive memory as a whole.
Such small and contained access to one's memories
is precisely recommended in order to
psychologically titrate ([p. 269](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1534765606297816?casa_token=GvFCvE_kR5QAAAAA:m96qsGNaYvdVq_0w_oGZfR6B0hYtbp1WiKL-sqeMnUTIAcZQ80hKZgpP2VoYHgEx1WoV60PVoHclww))
traumatic memories, i.e.

> prevent [people] from becoming so engaged
> with the traumatic material that
> they become overwhelmed
> by the powerful images and stories.

As with EMDR, titration is useful
not just with traumatic memories
but with addictive memories
or any intrusive memory
that causes emotional dysregulation.

#### Visuals

Lastly, when creating flashcards for memory management,
we are encouraged to liberally make use of
visuals in our questions and answers
(see rule 6 of the [20 rules](https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm)--"use imagery").
Such association of new,
hopefully less-disturbing visuals,
forges direct connections
between the intrusive memory
that is "frozen in time in its own neural network"
and other memory networks
(such as those holding the memory of our flashcard images).
Since words and images
activate related but distinct parts of our brain,
our new visual connections
complement associations formed through other mediums
such as psychoanalytic talk therapy.
Note stimulation of our visual processing,
while accessing intrusive or disturbing memories,
is also a major part of EMDR therapy and art therapies.
