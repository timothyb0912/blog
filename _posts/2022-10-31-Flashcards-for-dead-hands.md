# Flashcards for dead hands

%% See deadhand image %%

## Intrusive memories

Dear Young Tim,

> Why can't you leave the past in the past?

Over time, this question will bring much irony to our life.
When these words first slammed into our eardrums
like a pot thundering to the floor,
we rejected them outright.
Immediately, we rejected the premise we believed the question was based on.
After all, knowledge is power, right?
Why would we want to forget what we know of the past?
We then rejected the question itself as a distraction,
opting to "delve deeper" and focus on its motivating problems.

While not incorrect, the ironies would come months later,
after the motivating problems were indeed firmly placed in our past.
First there was the loss of appetite and pounds.
One pound, two pounds, ten pounds, and more.
For some time, flashbacks of painful past experiences would rob us of
preparatory time and desire to eat.
Not to be a "Debbie Downer" forever,
we eventually upgraded to more positive problems.
Here, pleasant memories would greet us upon waking
and usher us daily onto the dance floor
for an intensely dysregulating waltz of
happy -> sad -> angry, happy -> sad -> angry.
So, despite our initial reactions
and for different though related reasons,
we again asked "why can't we leave the past in the past?"

Merriam-Webster [defines](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dead%20hand) a "dead hand"
as "the oppressive influence of the past."
Whether pleasant or unpleasant,
[intrusive memories](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5938103/pdf/nihms915082.pdf)
have served as nature's faithful dead hands in our life.
In psychology jargon, these memories exist on a spectrum,
with traumatic (i.e. intensely unpleasant) memories on one end
and addictive (i.e. intensely pleasant) memories on the other end.
Regardless of their [valence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_(psychology)),
these memories are "unprocessed,"
hence their recurring intrusions and disturbing effects.
