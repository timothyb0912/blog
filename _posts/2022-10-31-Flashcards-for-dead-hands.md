# Flashcards for dead hands

%% See deadhand image %%

## Intrusive memories

Dear Young Tim,

> Why can't you leave the past in the past?

Over time, this question will bring much irony to our life.
When these words first slammed into our eardrums
like a pot thundering to the floor,
we rejected them outright.
Immediately, we rejected the premise we believed the question was based on.
After all, knowledge is power, right?
Why would we want to forget what we know of the past?
We then rejected the question itself as a distraction,
opting to "delve deeper" and focus on its motivating problems.

While not incorrect, the ironies would come months later,
after the motivating problems were indeed firmly placed in our past.
First there was the loss of appetite and pounds.
One pound, two pounds, ten pounds, and more.
For some time, flashbacks of painful past experiences would rob us of
preparatory time and desire to eat.
Not to be a "Debbie Downer" forever,
we eventually upgraded to more positive problems.
Here, pleasant memories would greet us upon waking
and usher us daily onto the dance floor
for an intensely dysregulating waltz of
happy -> sad -> angry, happy -> sad -> angry.
So, despite our initial reactions
and for different though related reasons,
we again asked "why can't we leave the past in the past?"

Merriam-Webster [defines](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dead%20hand) a "dead hand"
as "the oppressive influence of the past."
Whether pleasant or unpleasant,
[intrusive memories](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5938103/pdf/nihms915082.pdf)
have served as nature's faithful dead hands in our life.
These intruding memories may be thought of on a linear spectrum,
with traumatic (i.e. intensely unpleasant) memories on one end
and addictive (i.e. intensely pleasant) memories on the other end.
Both ends lead to dysfunction, though via differing mechanisms.


## Unprocessed memories

One therapy modality that has proven useful in treating
problems related to intrusive thoughts is EMDR.
EMDR has shown benefits in randomized controlled trials,
for both [traumatized](https://connect.springerpub.com/content/sgremdr/13/4/261.abstract) individuals (as with PTSD)
and individuals with [addictions](https://connect.springerpub.com/content/sgremdr/2/3/170.abstract).
Underlying the mechanisms of benefit in both situations
is a common understanding that "unprocessed" memories
lead to both types of intrusive memories and that accompanying sensations
then drive extreme beliefs and behaviors.
As [put](https://connect.springerpub.com/content/sgremdr/2/4/315.abstract)
by Solomon and Shapiro (creator of EMDR),

> Problems arise when an experience is inadequately processed.
> Shapiroâ€™s AIP [Adaptive Information Processing] model
> (1995, 2001, 2006)
> posits that a particularly distressing incident

> unable to connect with other memory networks

> She hypothesizes that when a memory is encoded in

> as well as overt symptoms
> (e.g., high anxiety, nightmares, intrusive thoughts) (p. 316).
> [...]
> Pathology is viewed as unprocessed memories, [...] (p. 318).

Similarly, other EMDR researchers would later [note](https://www.imagetransformationtherapy.org/traumatology-article-pdf.pdf)

> it is not the positive or negative quality of the feelings that is important
> in creating a state-dependent memory
> but the intensity of the feelings.

In both situations,
the explanation of unprocessed memories
begs the questions of what is a processed memory
and how can one process memories?

As [described](https://www.traumahealingforall.com/blog/how-to-tell-if-a-memory-needs-to-be-processed-aka-can-emdr-help-with-this) by EMDR therapist Laura Paton,

> A processed memory will generally be something
> that you know has happened,
> don't regularly think about,
> and when you do,
> it doesn't have any emotional charge associated with it,
> and you feel no need to bring it up regularly
> or think about it for a prolonged time.

According to Solomon and Shapiro ([p. 320](https://connect.springerpub.com/content/sgremdr/2/4/315.abstract)),
one key mechanism in processing memories is
associating otherwise disjointed fragments of memory.
Specifically, (re)processing a memory involves associating:
- the intrusive memory 'image'
- extreme beliefs related to the memory
- functional beliefs you instead wish to relate to the memory
- the current emotions related to the memory
- the current physical sensation related to the memory

These associations are thought to facilitate
"[memory reconsolidation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982213007719),"
wherein the information and form of the information accessed with
a memory is updated.
For example, we might update
emotion(s) and emotional strength of the memories,
beliefs based on the memory,
and experienced sensations (or the lack thereof).

As [described](https://pbspamericaconnect.org/resources/Documents/Ecker%20et%20al.%20-%20Primer%20on%20memory%20reconsolidation.pdf)
by Ecker et al (pp. 86 - 87),
memory reconsolidation roughly happens by

- accessing the disturbing memory
  and its explicitly associated beliefs, emotions, and sensations
- providing an alternative, less disturbing experience alongside the memory
  (such as with bilateral stimulation in EMDR desensitization phases)
- associating new, desired beliefs with the accessed, disturbing memory

This memory reconsolidation process also lies at the root of how
the Internal Family Systems (IFS) model of therapy works,
as pointed out by neuroscientist Dr. Frank Anderson
in "[Transcending Trauma](https://www.amazon.com/Transcending-Trauma-Healing-Complex-Internal/dp/B09BD7D6C7/):
Healing Complex PTSD with Internal Family Systems Therapy"
(ch. 24, \#The Science Behind The Healing).
This connection offers us guidance for synergistically combining
some of our pre-existing efforts
for emotional regulation and memory management.


## Memory management


### What and why

%% What is memory management? %%
%% --controlling what we remember and how we remember it %%
%% Why, briefly and according to earlier mentions---flashcards %%
%% Flashcards as explicit memory management, %%
 %% sentence + pointer %%
%% What link to emotional regulation? %%
%% --management of intrusive, unprocessed memories %%
The ultimate purpose of our memory management
is to better critical parts of our life.
Because whether or not we reconsolidate our intrusive memories
directly impacts our emotional regulation now and going forward
(i.e. a critical part of our life),
**intrusive memories and the actions we take on them
are critical components
in our memory management efforts**.
We may greatly benefit
from explicitly noting, acting upon, and strengthening
the connection between memory management and emotional regulation.
We'll start by considering
our practices and perspectives of emotional regulation
and how those impact our memory management.
Then, we'll look at what emotional regulation benefits we can glean
from our memory management practices and perspectives.

In [previous posts](https://timothyb0912.github.io/blog/psychology/2022/05/31/Emotional-leveraging.html) we've written about using IFS
techniques for and perspectives on emotional regulation.
These perspectives provide a window
through which we can view intrusive memories---
a view that is complementary to that of Shapiro's AIP model.
The IFS view of intrusive memories
then informs our memory management stance towards the intrusions.

Similarly, memory reconsolidation and the AIP model
provide a complementary view of IFS's
unburdening process.
In this case, the memory reconsolidation view of
the IFS unburdening process
suggests explicit points for beneficial
memory management interventions.

#### Views

First, intrusive memories show up as both "burdens" and as "trailheads"
in Internal Family Systems.
For instance, as described by [Bonnie Weiss](https://ifs-institute.com/practitioners/all/13712)
(a therapist certified in both EMDR and IFS),

> a burden is an extreme feeling, **memory** [emphasis added],
> energy or belief about oneself or about the world
> that a part has taken on as a result of childhood trauma,
> a specific incident, a relationship, or another painful situation.
> The burden is not natural to the part
> and therefore can be released.  
> ---[Self-Therapy Workbook](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IJY7F7A):
> An Exercise Book For The IFS Process
> (p. 107)

From this definition,
a logical next step is to use the IFS "unburdening process"
to release the burdens, the intrusive memories.
By name, the process focuses on "getting rid of this thing."
Despite our wishes otherwise,
the unburdening process is a long journey.
It begins with
making contact with the parts of our mind holding the burdens.
We make contact by exploring "trailheads."
Weiss writes that

> A *trailhead* is an experience or difficulty in your life
> that will lead to interesting parts if you follow it.
> It can be a situation or person that you react to,
> an emotional or bodily experience,
> a pattern of behavior or thinking,
> a dream, or anything else that indicates
> one or more parts to explore.
> IFS calls it a trailhead
> because it is the beginning of a trail that can lead to healing.
> ---[Self-Therapy Workbook](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IJY7F7A)(p. 17)

From here, we note a duality in our intrusive memories.
Certainly, the intrusions are burdens to be released.
However, they are also trailheads to be explored,
rather than avoided or suppressed.
IFS's trailhead terminology
highlights the need for investigating intrusive memories
in the reconsolidation process.
This investigative focus balances
the negative judgement connoted by terms such as
"intrusive memory", "burden," "pathology," etc.
The negative connotations of such words and concepts
may increase the likelihood one seeks relief
by intuitively staying away from the intrusive memories
rather than exploring them explicitly,
with care and compassion.

Accordingly, in the long-term,
we won't chronically respond to intrusive memories
with "just get over it" or "stop thinking about that."
To "get over" intrusive memories of our past,
i.e. to finally "leave the past in the past,"
we **want to** explore these memories,
in ways that result in memory reconsolidation.
Some such ways include IFS' unburdening process,
EMDR's phased approach, etc.


#### Brews

Memory reconsolidation in AIP or "unburdening" in IFS
is the "healing [of parts]" spoken of by Weiss and
the updating of "frozen in time" neural networks noted by Shapiro.
