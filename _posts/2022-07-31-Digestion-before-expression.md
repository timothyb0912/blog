# Digest before you express


## The challenge
%% Insert image of a kid chasing bubbles!%%
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/" width="800px">


%% When really young, we played with bubbles on the sidewalk with our sisters %%
%% Though the chase was great fun and the colorful objects beautiful, %%
%% we never could hold onto those slippery bubbles %%
%% Words are similar. %%
%% Cue Ralph Ammer quote %%

%% Personal relation to words from my mind---forgetting blog post contents %%

%% Need for remembering blog post contents to maximally benefit from them %%

%% Tragedy of life is to suffer one's success %%

%% To succeed in writing to ourselves but struggle to remember these writings would be tragedy %%


## Needs

%% Repeat need of remembering%%

%% Note desire to avoid feeling of "extra work" for post-hoc memory efforts" %%
%% Recognize desire for efficiency and energy conservation  %%

%% Generalize remembering need to learn, use, benefit %%

%% Recognize complementary need for TIME to consolidate and use learnings %%


## Solutions

%% Recall use of post-hoc mind maps for memory enhancement %%

%% Observe consolidation / blog-post creation process %%

%% Recognize two overlapping steps of thought organization pre-post and during mind map creation. %%

%% Combine, by organizing thoughts pre-post by creating and internalizing mind maps %%


## Process description

%% How are we using pre-post mind maps in service of post-creation and internalization? %%



## The forest behind the tree

%% With the basics described above, let's %%
%% Zoom out for fuller stock of our benefits and our connections to other trees in the forest %%

%% Footnote, notion of connection is not hyperbole. Trees communicate and are connected -- %%

### Benefits

%% Internalization and recall %%

%% Intermediate packets %%

%% Easier sharing -- personal picture can  help people UNDERSTAND via SEEING what you mean  %%
%% Recall Ralph Ammer in 'How Drawing Helps You Think' %%
%% Recall Susan Ruffins physical map providing a guide through the thicket for Elizabeth Chin (p.32-33) %%
%% See also the description on p. 191 - 192 %%
%% That's what these pictoral mind maps do--provide a guide through the thicket of words in our post %%


### Connections

%% Connections to self and prior thoughts -- map of blog contents %%

%% Connections to contemporaries -- Ali Abdaal %%

%% Connnections to humans through history -- Method of Loci%%


%% In our earliest youth, we chased the bubbles, trying to "catch em all" %%
%% Insert pokeball picture %%
%% This time, however, when seeking to hold onto the useful and beautiful in words %%
%% pictures may be the perfect frame for our exercise. %%
