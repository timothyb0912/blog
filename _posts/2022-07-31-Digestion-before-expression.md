# Digest before you express


## The challenge
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-07-31_bubbles.png" width="800px">

Dear Young Tim,

Do you recall the balmy July afternoons of our earliest youth?
When we shared summer vacations from school with our sisters?
We played on the sidewalk,
where my sisters blew bubbles,
and I ran them down,
determined to grasp each one before it hit the pavement.
Though the chase was great fun and the colorful orbs beautiful,
we never could hold onto those slippery bubbles.
Bubbles are ephemeral, and as it turns out, words are similar.
Or as [put](https://youtu.be/ZqlTSCvP-Z0?t=779) by Ralph Ammer,

Unfortunately, it is not just the words of others that are hard to hold onto.
The aforementioned slipperiness
also films words
drawn from the wellspring of our own mind.
For example, over time, we forget the contents of our own blog posts.

This forgetting is problematic,
because maximally benefitting from our blog posts,
requires that we remember them.
As noted in Sadhguru's [article](https://isha.sadhguru.org/yoga/yoga-articles-mind-stress/organizing-mind-success/) [^1]
on organizing one's mind and body for success,
"[i]f you suffer your failure it is bad enough,
but if you suffer your success,
then your life is 100% tragedy."
To succeed in writing to ourselves,
and to then struggle to remember these writings
is indeed a tragedy.


## Needs
%% Repeat need of remembering%%
%% Generalize remembering need to learn, use, benefit %%
%% Recognize complementary need for TIME to consolidate and use learnings %%
So Young Tim,
what is it that we need to avoid tragedy,
or put more constructively,
what do we need to flourish?
We already noted
that we need to remember the content of our blog posts
to most benefit from them.
Relatedly, if we consider life more broadly,
then as [noted](http://sfhelp.org/relate/keys/needs.htm) by social worker Peter Gerlach,
we need to "learn about the world,
and to use this knowledge"
(implying rememberance of our learnings).
Hidden in this general requirement is a complementary need for time.
Specifically, we need time to consolidate, ingrain, and use our learnings about the world.

%% Note desire to avoid feeling of "extra work" for post-hoc memory efforts" %%
In practice, there is tension between our needs for time and for remembering.
Memory improvement efforts require an (at least initial) investment of time,
and these efforts feel like "extra work" when performed after information consumption.
Indeed, we've repeatedly chosen time to create or consolidate learnings over time to ingrain them.
That is, despite our desire to remember our blog posts,
we've only covered a few of them using memory encoding techniques.
How can we understand our eschewal of post-consumption,
memory-aiding study efforts,
and how can we act effectively to meet our needs
given our newfound understanding?



## Solutions
%% Recognize desire for efficiency and energy conservation  %%
%% We can view our resistance to such "extra work" as unconscious efforts %%
%% at conservation and efficient use of our time and energy. %%
%% Recall use of post-hoc mind maps for memory enhancement %%
[Internal Family Systems](https://ifs-institute.com/) (IFS) offers one approach
for getting to know parts of ourselves
that may favor particular decisions
or hold particular feelings.
Integral to the IFS [process](https://www.therapywithalessio.com/articles/the-6-fs-in-ifs-the-6-steps-to-get-to-know-our-protectors)
is developing a sense of compassion towards our parts of mind,
and this often comes along with recognizing the positive intentions of our parts.
Regarding our decisions to avoid memorizing past blog post contents,
our underlying desire was to be time and energy efficient.
We don't like activities that *feel* like extra work.

%% Observe consolidation / blog-post creation process %%
Focusing on this goal of efficiency,
i.e. taking the perspective of the study-avoidant part of ourselves,
we see redundant efforts in our current process
for consolidating our learnings using our blog.
In particular,
we first organize our thoughts on what we've learned about the world,
and then we write our blog post.
In practice, we next wait some time until the post is no longer top of mind,
then we extract the organization and details of our thought from the blog post,
and finally, we create and memorize a mindmap based on this organization and details.

%% Recognize two overlapping steps of thought organization pre-post and during mind map creation. %%
Our current procedure is based upon prior, valid realizations.
For example, we've previously posted about how post-hoc mind maps and similar diagrams
help promote understanding, organization, and memorization.
We first noted this phenomenon in
[Causally Engineering Life](https://timothyb0912.github.io/blog/reading/2021/02/28/Causally-Engineering-Life.html),
and we discussed it more thoroughly in
[Heavy on the Graphs](https://timothyb0912.github.io/blog/psychology/practice/2022/04/30/Graph-Heavy.html).
Still though, the fact that we are procrastinating on using this process
points to additional physical and mental realizations---in this case,
feelings and sensations that we can make [better choices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).

%% Invert, stupid. Invert.%%
%% Combine, by organizing thoughts pre-post by creating and internalizing mind maps %%
Of course, making better choices is difficult in hindsight
Luckily, life often gives us the chance to make better decisions going forward.
In particular, we believe some variant of the process above
to be amongst the most beneficial way to internalize already written posts.
However, when considering posts yet to be written,
we can indeed streamline our process for remembering what we've learned.
To do so, we use a software engineering principle for promoting efficient programming:
"Don't Repeat Yourself ([DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself))."
The idea is to be efficient by avoiding duplication.
By [inverting](https://fs.blog/inversion/) our process
so we create and internalize mind maps **before** writing our blog posts
rather than afterwards,
we can move from two instances of mental organization to one.


## Mechanisms

Why...Why does this inversion benefit us?
Our idea is founded on the experience / anecdote / observation
that blog post writing is analogous---
in terms of information organization---
to drawing and memorizing a mind map,
yet we generally find it easier to describe what we see
than to see what has been described to us.

Mind maps are images that are "seen"
whereas blog posts are descriptions that are "read."
Accordingly, in a more mathematical notation,
we might say
blog_post(mind_map(thought)) = "reading from mind-map" = "explanation",
mind_map(blog_post(thought)) = "drawing from blog post" = "organization",
and blog_post(mind_map(thought)) < mind_map(blog_post(thought)) in difficulty.

We hypothesize that this asymmetry in ease of composition
comes from talking (and titling as a special form of talking).
Talking provides the detailed information
and titling of mind map sections (i.e. subgraphs)
provides the sectional information
that is present in a blog post
but missing in a mind map.
Conversely, we know of no similar intermediary
that provides the relational / structural / spatial information
that is present in a mind map
but missing in a blog post.
As a result, we can make a mind map,
and then produce a blog post "cheaply"
by talking through and talking about our mind map.
In comparison, writing a blog post only negligibly lowers
the effort required to draw the mind map of that posts' ideas.
Much mental effort is still needed to choose and clarify
connections between nodes in the mind map or the lack thereof.


## Process description

%% How are we using pre-post mind maps in service of post-creation and internalization? %%
%% Below describes what we are doing, but not why we are doing it this way. %%
%% It feels dropped out of thin air %%
So, just how are we using mind maps while writing our blogs?

To capitalize on and operationlize the translational ease described above,
we've found the following process useful so far.

First, to document, clarify, and organize an idea,
we start by making a mind map, either on paper or digitally.
Next, we create anki questions based on this mind map.
These questions take the form of node occlusion cards,
where the question covers (i.e. occludes) one node
and the answer is whatever was originally contained in that node.
After making one node occlusion card per node in the mind map,
we then turn to create subgraphs.
These subgraphs are used to create more node occlusion cards---
cards that this time that cover all nodes of the subgraph at once.
Note that our subgraphs are based on intuitive groupings of nodes,
thereby assisting with chunking and ultimately retention.

After splitting the mind map into subgraphs,
we order these subgraphs in an intuitive sequence,
as if we were using them
to explain (er, present) the entire mind map to someone else.
This sequencing with aim to explain is also helpful for our memory efforts.
Continuing the explanation exercise,
we note the questions that we would ask,
such that the subgraph was the answer
or a visualization of our answer.

If desired,
we can use the questions
and their associated subgraphs
for a presentation outline.
We could use the questions as slide titles,
and we could use the subgraphs as the body of the slides.
Lastly, we use the earlier sequence of subgraphs
to order both the slides and questions.
The ordered questions directly
form our blog post outline,
and we create the post
by answering the questions,
describing the subgraphs,
and elaborating on the subgraphs.


## The forest behind the tree

%% With the basics described above, let's %%
%% Zoom out for fuller stock of our benefits and our connections to other trees in the forest %%
Okay, so what has all of this gotten us in the end?
If describing our motivation and process
is like drawing the roots, trunk, and leaves of a great tree,
then this is a fine time to step back,
to appreciate the fruits of our labor,
and to take stock of the connections[^2] we've forged
with other trees in the forest.
Metaphors aside,
let's consider the bigger picture
in which our digestion before expression is situated.
What is the spectrum of benefits from this practice,
and how do we relate to ourselves and others through this process?


### Benefits

%% Internalization and recall %%
%% Intermediate packets %%
Let's start by looking at what we gain from this procedure.
Our first obvious benefit is greater internalization and recall of our blog posts,
relative to not using any memory techniques to study the posts.
The next set of benefits stems from our creation of multiple [intermediate packets](https://fortelabs.co/blog/bending-the-curves-of-productivity/):
- mind map
- set of anki flashcards
- set of subraphs
- sequence of subgraphs
- presentation (outline)
- blog post (outline)

These intermediate packets act as rungs on a ladder,
enabling more systematic and smoother transition
from initial thought to completed statement
(i.e. blog post and / or presentation).

By having greater internalization and recall of our thoughts on a topic
AND by having more production endpoints, thereby allowing for easy transitions,
we are better able to restart at any of these parts of the digestion process
and to easily resume expression of the next product in our procedure.

%% Easier sharing -- personal picture can  help people UNDERSTAND via SEEING what you mean  %%
Finally, in creating these intermediate packets,
we greatly diversify the mediums in which we express our thoughts.
For example, we create images (mind maps, subgraphs, slide decks),
text (blog posts),
and potentially audio or video, if we record our presentations.
These diverse media ease our sharing our thoughts with other people,
as some individuals will find some media more accessible than others.

%% Recall Ralph Ammer in 'How Drawing Helps You Think' %%
%% Recall Susan Ruffins physical map providing a guide through the thicket for Elizabeth Chin (p.32-33) %%
%% See also the description on p. 191 - 192 %%
Think of images as a medium versus text.
In doing so, let's recall the words of Ralph Ammer, quoted above.
His quote actually [ends](https://youtubetranscript.com/?v=ZqlTSCvP-Z0) by saying
"[i]t is hard for us to anchor words in our minds,
and drawings can help make them stick."
Shifting our attention from images in general,
to the specific image category of mind maps,
we can consider the experience of author Elizabeth Chin
in her autoethnography
"[My Life with Things](https://www.amazon.com/My-Life-Things-Consumer-Diaries-ebook/dp/B01FO18E84/)."
She too "mind" mapped her writing---her book---before (fully) writing it.
She states

> As with many other writers,
> there came a time where I felt stuck.
> [...] The problem was that I really could not see
> how to shape what I had written into a book.
> My friend Susan Ruffins rescued me from that state.
> She took the manuscript in hand,
> laid out entries across her office,
> [i.e. made a physical map of documents,]
> picked them up in one spot
> and put them down in another
> [...]. In my case I needed a guide through the thicket.
> ---p. 32

%% That's what these pictoral mind maps do--provide a guide through the thicket of words in our post %%
This is the role played by mind maps.
They provide a pictoral guide
through the thicket of words in our posts,
for ourselves and for others.


### Connections

%% Connections to self and prior thoughts -- map of blog contents %%

%% Connections to contemporaries -- Ali Abdaal %%

%% Connnections to humans through history -- Method of Loci%%


%% In our earliest youth, we chased the bubbles, trying to "catch em all" %%
%% Insert pokeball picture %%
%% This time, however, when seeking to hold onto the useful and beautiful in words %%
%% pictures may be the perfect frame for our exercise. %%
