# Digest before you express


## The challenge
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-07-31_bubbles.png" width="800px">

Dear Young Tim,

Do you recall the balmy July afternoons of our earliest youth?
When we shared summer vacations from school with our sisters?
We played on the sidewalk,
where my sisters blew bubbles,
and I ran them down,
determined to grasp each one before it hit the pavement.
Though the chase was great fun and the colorful orbs beautiful,
we never could hold onto those slippery bubbles.
Bubbles are ephemeral, and as it turns out, words are similar.
Or as [put](https://youtu.be/ZqlTSCvP-Z0?t=779) by Ralph Ammer,

Unfortunately, it is not just the words of others that are hard to hold onto.
The aforementioned slipperiness
also films words
drawn from the wellspring of our own mind.
For instance, over time, we forget the contents of our own blog posts.

This forgetting is problematic,
because maximally benefitting from our blog posts,
requires that we remember them.
As noted in Sadhguru's [article](https://isha.sadhguru.org/yoga/yoga-articles-mind-stress/organizing-mind-success/) [^1]
on organizing one's mind and body for success,
"[i]f you suffer your failure it is bad enough,
but if you suffer your success,
then your life is 100% tragedy."
To succeed in writing to ourselves,
and to then struggle to remember these writings
is indeed a tragedy.


## Needs
%% Repeat need of remembering%%
%% Generalize remembering need to learn, use, benefit %%
%% Recognize complementary need for TIME to consolidate and use learnings %%
So Young Tim,
what is it that we need to avoid tragedy,
or put more constructively,
what do we need to flourish?
We already noted
that we need to remember the content of our blog posts
to most benefit from them.
Relatedly, if we consider life more broadly,
then as [noted](http://sfhelp.org/relate/keys/needs.htm) by social worker Peter Gerlach,
we need to "learn about the world,
and to use this knowledge"
(implying rememberance of our learnings).
Hidden in this general requirement is a complementary need for time.
Specifically, we need time to consolidate, ingrain, and use our learnings about the world.

%% Note desire to avoid feeling of "extra work" for post-hoc memory efforts" %%
In practice, there is tension between our needs for time and for remembering.
Memory improvement efforts require an (at least initial) investment of time,
and these efforts feel like "extra work" when performed after information consumption.
Indeed, we've repeatedly chosen time to create or consolidate learnings over time to ingrain them.
That is, despite our desire to remember our blog posts,
we've only covered a few of them using memory encoding techniques.
How can we understand our eschewal of post-consumption,
memory-aiding study efforts,
and how can we act effectively to meet our needs
given our newfound understanding?



## Solutions
%% Recognize desire for efficiency and energy conservation  %%
%% We can view our resistance to such "extra work" as unconscious efforts %%
%% at conservation and efficient use of our time and energy. %%
%% Recall use of post-hoc mind maps for memory enhancement %%
[Internal Family Systems](https://ifs-institute.com/) (IFS) offers one approach
for getting to know parts of ourselves
that may favor particular decisions
or hold particular feelings.
Integral to the IFS [process](https://www.therapywithalessio.com/articles/the-6-fs-in-ifs-the-6-steps-to-get-to-know-our-protectors)
is developing a sense of compassion towards our parts of mind,
and this often comes along with recognizing the positive intentions of our parts.
Regarding our decisions to avoid memorizing past blog post contents,
our underlying desire was to be time and energy efficient.
We don't like activities that *feel* like extra work.

%% Observe consolidation / blog-post creation process %%
Focusing on this goal of efficiency,
i.e. taking the perspective of the study-avoidant part of ourselves,
we see redundant efforts in our current process
for consolidating our learnings using our blog.
In particular,
we first organize our thoughts on what we've learned about the world,
and then we write our blog post.
In practice, we next wait some time until the post is no longer top of mind,
then we extract the organization and details of our thought from the blog post,
and finally, we create and memorize a mindmap based on this organization and details.

%% Recognize two overlapping steps of thought organization pre-post and during mind map creation. %%
Our current procedure is based upon prior, valid realizations.
For example, we've previously posted about how post-hoc mind maps and similar diagrams
help promote understanding, organization, and memorization.
We first noted this phenomena in
[Causally Engineering Life](https://timothyb0912.github.io/blog/reading/2021/02/28/Causally-Engineering-Life.html),
and we discussed it more thoroughly in
[Heavy on the Graphs](https://timothyb0912.github.io/blog/psychology/practice/2022/04/30/Graph-Heavy.html).
Still though, the fact that we are procrastinating on using this process
points to additional physical and mental realizations---in this case,
feelings and sensations that we can make [better choices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).

%% Invert, stupid. Invert.%%
%% Combine, by organizing thoughts pre-post by creating and internalizing mind maps %%
Of course, making better choices is difficult in hindsight
Luckily, life often gives us the chance to make better decisions going forward.
In particular, we believe some variant of the process above
to be amongst the most beneficial way to internalize already written posts.
However, when considering posts yet to be written,
we can indeed streamline our process for remembering what we've learned.
To do so, we use a software engineering principle for promoting efficient programming:
"Don't Repeat Yourself ([DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself))."
The idea is to be efficient by avoid duplication.
By [inverting](https://fs.blog/inversion/) our process
so we create and internalize mind maps **before** writing our blog posts
rather than afterwards,
we can move from two instances of mental organization to one.

%% How are we using pre-post mind maps in service of post-creation and internalization? %%



## The forest behind the tree

%% With the basics described above, let's %%
%% Zoom out for fuller stock of our benefits and our connections to other trees in the forest %%

%% Footnote, notion of connection is not hyperbole. Trees communicate and are connected -- %%

### Benefits

%% Internalization and recall %%

%% Intermediate packets %%

%% Easier sharing -- personal picture can  help people UNDERSTAND via SEEING what you mean  %%
%% Recall Ralph Ammer in 'How Drawing Helps You Think' %%
%% Recall Susan Ruffins physical map providing a guide through the thicket for Elizabeth Chin (p.32-33) %%
%% See also the description on p. 191 - 192 %%
%% That's what these pictoral mind maps do--provide a guide through the thicket of words in our post %%


### Connections

%% Connections to self and prior thoughts -- map of blog contents %%

%% Connections to contemporaries -- Ali Abdaal %%

%% Connnections to humans through history -- Method of Loci%%


%% In our earliest youth, we chased the bubbles, trying to "catch em all" %%
%% Insert pokeball picture %%
%% This time, however, when seeking to hold onto the useful and beautiful in words %%
%% pictures may be the perfect frame for our exercise. %%
