# Missed Conversations

## TLDR



## Overview

## The setup

Dear Young Tim,

We have an immense backlog of missing conversations. Why?

Following the Internal Family Systems [model](https://ifs-institute.com/resources/articles/internal-family-systems-model-outline)
of the human psyche,
we posit that the default state of people is that we:

- exile parts of our mind
  that carry extreme, "unaccepted", or unpleasant
  thoughts, emotions, and behaviors,
- preemptively control our lives to avoid triggering the exiled parts
- reactively repress the exiled parts of mind
  if we fail to avoid their triggering.

As children, the external world relates to us in this way.
Think of how many kids are told to
"stop crying before I give you something to cry about!" (repression)
Accordingly, we learn at a young age
that it is unsafe to openly and thoroughly discuss
the most important topics in our life.
If we offend the wrong people we could be physically attacked
(e.g. by bullies, gang members,
or parents enacting corporal punishment).
Generally, speaking too candidly about problems
could also lead to social attack:
public shaming, reputation tarnishing, and opportunity loss.
Depending one's precise problems,
one could even lose freedom via
prisons, psychiatric wards and forced medication,
conservatorships, etc.

In this sense, last month's
[discussion](https://timothyb0912.github.io/blog/practice/2022/08/31/Growing-Pains.html)
of Gendlin's Litany
is strictly to be interpreted internally.
Gendlin's Litany says that
> [w]hat is true is already so.  
> Owning up to itÂ doesn't make it worse.  

However, if we aggravate those
who believe they benefit from
weaponizing, ignoring, or hiding an issue,
then speaking up about true problems
can absolutely make them worse.
Predation, retaliation, and retribution exist.

So, after externally relating with others,
we begin to proactively and internally relate in these same
exiling, controlling, and repressing ways.
Our childhood reasoning is that
it is better for us to exile, control, and repress parts of ourselves
than to have others do this to us.
In the process,
we learn to avoid internally discussing,
i.e. [thinking](https://timothyb0912.github.io/blog/psychology/2021/08/16/Effective-thinking-is-effective-communication.html),
about the most important topics in our life.
These are precisely those topics
that activate extreme or unpleasant
thoughts, emotions, or behaviors in us or others.

These missing discussions about the important topics in life
are then reinforced by multiple societal factors.
For example, we may lack privacy:
written, digital, sonic, or visual.
Without ability to privately externalize our thoughts,
it becomes difficult to think deeply about a topic,
especially when that topic is socially rejected.
Similarly, social pressures and financial pressures take our time.
Without time, it is hard to calm ourselves
and think continuously about anything.

Finally, even if we find time and privacy,
we encounter natural human tendencies
to avoid unpleasant feelings.
Such unpleasant feelings include
the fear of uncertainty that comes with original thought.
Few people enjoy being confused
and experiencing internal conflict,
especially without external help.

The end result of these missing conversations
is a mass of unresolved problems that were never thought through
and confusion about the state of our world.
From this confusion comes an inability to act effectively.
And without ability to act effectively,
we are unable to cope with unfolding events in our lives.
This is an extremely dangerous position.

For instance, famed military strategist John Boyd
explicitly [stated](https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/AUPress/Books/B_0151_Boyd_Discourse_Winning_Losing.pdf)
that an aim of operations was to

> Enmesh [an] adversary in an amorphous, menacing,
> and unpredictable world  
> of uncertainty, doubt, mistrust,
> **confusion** [emphasis added],
> disorder, fear, panic, chaos [...]  
> so that our adversary cannot cope---while
> we can cope---with events as they unfold.
> "A Discourse on Winning and Losing"(p. 155)

Obviously, we wish to avoid being in such states of mind
for extended periods of time.


## Needs

To avoid or overcome the aforementioned confusion,
we need clarity in our lives.
In particular, we want to develop clarity around:
  - what is the nature of our reality and experiences?
  - what do we want, why do we want it,
    and how dow we acquire / achieve / embody it?
  - what do we NOT want, why not, and how to avoid it?

Answering these questions
requires us to have the missing, internal conversations
described in the last section.
Through such thought we come to know ourselves
and the world around us.


## Round tables

At their core, what do such missing conversations involve?
As posited in Internal Family Systems,
we consider our mind to have multiple parts
and as corollary---multiple sets of opinions.
When we are confused,
we have conflicting opinions
that reflect conflicting parts of mind.
One part of us may hold a specific mental model of the world,
yet another part of us recognizes this mental model's
incorrect predictions.
Similarly, when we consider topics that rouse
unpleasant emotions or undesired actions,
we also have conflicting parts.
Some parts that carry or use the unpleasant emotions and actions,
and other parts that seek to
exile, preempt, or repress those emotions and actions.

In all cases, clarity is gained by engaging conflicting parts
in dialogue about the polarization.

- What does each part believe?
- When and why were these beliefs formed?
- What is the evidence for each part's beliefs?
- What are the short-term and long-term consequences
  of the beliefs and actions of each part?
- What are the concerns and positive intentions of each part?
- What needs does each part of mind have?
- What would need to be true to resolve the concerns of all parts?

In these polarization dialogues,
our primary aim is not to "pick a winner."
Indeed, all parts of our mind may be mistaken.
The aim is to first deeply understand our experiences
and then what we want and don't want to do about them.
Such internal conversation between conflicting parts
is the essence of both
psychologist Jay Earley's [Resolving Inner Conflict](https://personal-growth-programs.com/products/resolving-inner-conflict/)
and investor Charlie Munger's [work required](https://fs.blog/the-work-required-to-have-an-opinion/)
to have an opinion.
