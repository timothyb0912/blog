# Missed Conversations

## TLDR

## The setup

Dear Young Tim,

We have an immense backlog of missing conversations. Why?

Following the Internal Family Systems [model](https://ifs-institute.com/resources/articles/internal-family-systems-model-outline)
of the human psyche,
we posit that the default state of people is that we:

- exile parts of our mind
  that carry extreme, "unaccepted", or unpleasant
  thoughts, emotions, and behaviors,
- preemptively control our lives to avoid triggering the exiled parts
- reactively repress the exiled parts of mind
  if we fail to avoid their triggering.

As children, the external world relates to us in this way.
Think of how many kids are told to
"stop crying before I give you something to cry about!"
Accordingly, we learn at a young age
that it is unsafe to openly and thoroughly discuss
the most important topics in our life.
If we offend the wrong people we could be physically attacked
(e.g. by bullies, gang members,
or parents enacting corporal punishment).
Generally, speaking too candidly about problems
could also lead to social attack:
public shaming, reputation tarnishing, and opportunity loss.
Depending one's precise problems,
one could even find lose freedom via
prisons, psychiatric wards, conservatorships, etc.

In this sense, last month's
[discussion](https://timothyb0912.github.io/blog/practice/2022/08/31/Growing-Pains.html)
of Gendlin's Litany
is strictly to be interpreted internally.
Gendlin's Litany says that
> [w]hat is true is already so.  
> Owning up to itÂ doesn't make it worse.  

However, if we aggravate those
who believe they benefit from ignoring or hiding an issue,
then speaking up about true problems
can absolutely make them worse.
Retaliation and retribution exists.

And so, after externally relating with others,
we begin to proactively and internally relate in these same
exiling, controlling, and repressing ways.
Our childhood reasoning is that
it is better for us to exile, control, and repress ourselves
than to have others do this to us.
In the process,
we learn to avoid internally discussing,
i.e. [thinking](https://timothyb0912.github.io/blog/psychology/2021/08/16/Effective-thinking-is-effective-communication.html),
about the most important topics in our life.
These are precisely those topics
that activate extreme or unpleasant
thoughts, emotions, or behaviors in us or others.

These missing discussions about the important topics in life
are then reinforced by multiple societal factors.
For example, we may lack privacy:
written, digital, sonic, or visual.
Without ability to privately externalize our thoughts,
it becomes difficult to think deeply about a topic,
especially when that topic is socially rejected.
Similarly, social pressures and financial pressures take our time.
Without time, it is hard to calm ourselves
and think continuously about anything.

Finally, even if we find time and privacy,
we encounter natural human tendencies
to avoid unpleasant feelings.
Such unpleasant feelings include
the fear of uncertainty that comes with original thought.
Few people enjoy being confused
and experiencing internal conflict,
especially without external help.

The end result of these missing conversations
is a mass of unresolved problems that were never thought through
and confusion about the state of our world.
From confusion comes an inability to act effectively.
And without ability to act effectively,
we are unable to cope with unfolding events in our lives.
This is an extremely dangerous position.

Famed military strategist John Boyd
explicitly [stated](https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/AUPress/Books/B_0151_Boyd_Discourse_Winning_Losing.pdf)
that an aim of operations was to

> Enmesh adversary in an amorphous, menacing,
> and unpredictable world  
> of uncertainty, doubt, mistrust,
> **confusion** [emphasis added],
> disorder, fear, panic, chaos [...]
> so that our adversary cannot cope---while
> we can cope---with events as they unfold.
> "A Discourse on Winning and Losing"(p. 155)

Obviously, we wish to avoid such states of mind and being.
