# Journal more and journal systematically

## Outline

- context:
  longtime journaling since high school.
  running log + record of thoughts while running.
  transitioned into simply journaling about particular important topic matters:
  research, exercise,
- problem:
  Life is full of hard times (in personal life, at wok, with family, etc.),
  a global pandemic is raging,
  and I have a rough childhood that needs addressing.
  Under such conditions I have many thoughts,
  and a systematic journaling habit is needed,
  and I need to make daily use of it to crystallize and capture my thoughts for
  refinement and addressing.
- beneficial_change: (strategy) adopting a colorful journaling system
  - on-the-fly thoughts in real-time
  - structured notes (short to medium) of sundry kinds
  - unstructured / non-standardly-structured (medium to long)
    reflections & thoughts
- tactics:
  - git (version control) + tooling (journaling niceties):
    - git-bug
    - nb
    - kb
  - sources of structure:
    - emotion prompts
      (to be filled in during the "C" of ABCDs of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.)

- results:
  - mental trend spotting -> insight / hypothesis generation
  - decreased anxiety in the present
    as thoughts are captured rather than lost
  - helpful reminders from past thoughts


## Draft
Dear Young Tim,

Thanks so much for your patience as I get these notes to you,
albeit with delay.
The last many months have been trying, to say the least.

During this time of adversity,
I'm reminded that much of adulthood is about trying to
rekindle and maintain the enjoyable from your childhood,
while still fulfilling your present responsibilities.
Journaling---writing one's subjective thoughts and feelings---
is one such enjoyable practice from my youth that still pays dividends.

In particular, life is full of hard times.
This includes hardships in one's
personal, professional, familial, social, and romantic life.
Considering worldwide as opposed to individualistic concerns,
our hardships also include the global Covid-19 pandemic and
economic recession that are still raging as well.
Under such conditions,
one's mind is expected to be flooded with many thoughts.
And indeed, without a management system, one may find oneself
drowning in a deluge of thoughts and emotions.

In such contexts,
journaling has long been one way for me to capture my steady
stream of ideas and inner monologues.
For instance, in high school,
I used my running logs to record not just what workouts I ran
but also whatever I thought about while running.
In graduate school, I turned to using a research journal that
housed my thoughts and feelings on potential research topics.
After school, I've returned to journaling,
now about the full range of concerns in my life,
from research to home repairs and everything in between.

Young Tim,
this third wave of journaling is different from the first two.
It's more all-encompassing.
All topics are fair game to be journaled about.
It's more systematic.
I use self-determined triggers for some journaling activities.
I use templates and prompts for some journaling activities.
I organize my journals, by more than just chronological order.
While these practices certainly entail additional effort,
the benefits have been worth far more than the costs.

For instance, the immediate benefits I've enjoyed include
- greater self-respect as I acknowledge, fully engage with,
  and record my thoughts and feelings for all topics
  as opposed to only a select few.
- deeper thinking, more regularly, as I complete
  pre-planned templates (e.g. for decision records).  
  These templates inspire further thought they guide me to
  answer questions I otherwise may forget or neglect to ask.
- better guidance of my thoughts via broadening questions,
  especially when emotionally flustered.  
  E.g., I took a [conversations course](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-better-relationships/) that posited that
  the one who most guides a conversation is
  the one asking the questions,
  not the one doing the answering.
  With question prompts coming from
  cognitive behavioral therapy,
  I've been frequently able to direct my thinking,
  to more logical, less catastrophized, & less distorted ends,
  rather than being merely subject to them.
- comfort from always being able to talk with oneself
  on the page,
  especially when one cannot talk with others in the moment.

So how have I garnered these benefits?
At a high level, I adopted the following system.

First, I take short, on-the-fly notes about my thoughts,
in real-time.
These are the thoughts that arise in a 'disrupting' manner---
thoughts that are not focused the specific task being done.
Such on-the-fly notes are typically (though not always)
unstructured.

Secondly, I use structured notes of sundry kinds.
These notes are typically of short to medium length.
That is, a few sentences to a few paragraphs.
These might be the notes that correspond to
'disputing a belief with evidence'
in cognitive behavioral therapy,
or the decision templates utilized in
architecture decision records.

Lastly, I use unstructured notes
to capture medium to long reflections and thoughts.
These notes are typically answers to single question prompts,
or they are complex, spontaneous thoughts,
born of long-running hyperfocus on a particular topic.
Examples here may be one-time questions that ask me to
recount particular meaningful events from my past / childhood.

Between these three types of notes,
I have been/felt able to capture all of the thoughts I desire.
