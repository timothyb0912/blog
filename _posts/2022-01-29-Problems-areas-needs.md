# On problems, areas, and needs

<!-- How do I want to greet Young Tim? -->
Dear Young Tim,

Happy New Year! Thanks so much for getting us here.
I'm particularly grateful that you've taken such a motivated stance towards
getting a handle on the problems we're facing.

This starts with following the suggestion from December's post:
making a list of all of our problems.
By now, you've realized that this task is a large one.
In fact, the task is so large as to be an obstacle.
Here, I'd like to offer some help.

<!-- What do I understand of Young Tim's feelings? -->
First, I hope you take comfort in how expected it is
that you are anxious to stop using anxiety to keep track of all our problems.
You have operated in a stressful state beyond your capacity for decades.
I would be suspicious if you were NOT anxious to exit this state of being.

<!-- What is our intent? -->
My intent in this note is to help us get all our problems out of our mind,
so we can more easily prioritize and stay aware of them.
I suggest an approach which, although less direct,
may be more successful than sitting down to write a single, unstructured list.
As it is sometimes said, *insert transportation joke*,
sometimes the shortest path is the longer route that's less traveled.

<!-- What is the problem with directly following December's advice? -->
Here is the problem with December's advice to list our problems:
you feel overwhelmed because there are way too many problems.
Too many to list in one sitting.
Too many to hold in your mind at once.
Too many to review at once.

<!-- What is one challenge we face in overcoming this problem? -->
If we reframe our listing problem, one challenge we're facing is
how to retain simultaneous awareness of a large number of sub-problems,
without triggering feelings of overwhelm.
Fundamentally, this is a challenge of organizing our sub-problems.

<!-- How can we solve it? -->
In addressing this challenge, we can look to writers such as
George Polya: author of the mathematics classic "How to Solve It."
Polya suggests, as one strategy for dealing with hard problems,
to solve easier but related problems.
E.g. if listing our problem is hard, what can we list easily?
How can these easier lists  help us complete the problem list?
How can we create [intermediate packets](https://fortelabs.co/blog/just-in-time-pm-4-intermediate-packets/)?

Two easier and useful lists to create are:
- a list of our needs, at an abstract level
- a list of the areas in our life, that we use in order to meet our needs

The diagram below depicts these lists, our problem list,
and relations between them.

<!-- Why is the problems-areas-needs association helpful? -->
Here's what I think makes this triangular view beneficial.
By projecting from the high dimensional list of problems,
to complimentary, lower dimensional lists,
we can aid our review and planning for problem-solving.
For example, I estimate that I have more than 200 problems.
However, I list only 12 - 30 needs, depending on how I count.
Likewise, when I list the various areas of my life, I have approximately 30.
Such magnitudes are much less foreboding,
and they are of the same order as "reasonably short" lengths of time--
like a month.

Additionally, one can think of problems as undesired outcomes,
with respect to our hill-climbing or improvement efforts
against the following objective:
maximizing satisfaction of our needs,
subject to avoiding system failure in any one of our life's areas.
Listing our areas and needs, and connecting them to our problems,
helps us stay aware of the underlying components giving our problems relevance.

<!-- How can we make immediate use of these associations? -->
So how can we reap these benefits?
Start by listing all of the areas in one's life:
reviewing, planning, bicycles, nutrition, health, etc.
Then, list all of the fundamental needs you have in life.
Finally, think of the problems you are currently facing.
List all that come to mind before you feel intimidated by the number of issues.
When you're done with your initial listing,
you can categorize your initial problems into their respective life areas and
associate the problems with the (unmet) needs that they relate to.
Now, you'll be able to use the areas and needs as categories
that cue your review and that you sequentially list problems in.

Young Tim, I hope this advice helps you create an overall view of your problems.
I'm excited to see where you'll go once you have a fuller view of the terrain!
Till next time,
