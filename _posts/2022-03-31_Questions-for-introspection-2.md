# Questions for Introspection: Part 2

Dear Young Tim,

Happy end of the first quarter of 2022!

Being a time of endings and new beginnings,
this seems a good time to close the loop
on our posts from September and October, 2021.
To bring us all back up to speed,
the scene is as follows.

We're often trying to continually self-improve.
The process for this improvement involves introspecting,
to make clear and then make right
our beliefs, wants, needs, feelings, and behavioral patterns.
This diagram depicts how the various elements of
our introspection relate to each other.
Beyond illustrations,
it is helpful, especially in emotionally charged moments,
to have a list of questions to ask
about each introspection element.

Our post from October 2021 provided such a list
for one portion of nodes in the graph above.
Today's post provides a list for our remaining
introspection graph elements.
These elements cover the parts of our story that give context
for our behavioral decisions and feelings.

As before, these questions are stated without introduction,
since the elements of our introspection graph were described
previously, in September 2021's post.

## Needs and emotional wounds

## State beliefs

## Outcome beliefs

## Goals

## Failure states

## Pre-decision feelings
