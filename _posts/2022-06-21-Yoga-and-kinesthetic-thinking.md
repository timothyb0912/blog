# Yoga and kinesthetic thinking

%%Insert diagram of blog post%%

> Daaaaaaamn, you TIGHT!

So went the familiar refrain across New York City schoolyards
throughout the 2000's.


## Issues
%%What are the issues motivating yoga for me?%%

Dear Young Tim,

Like the best slang sung by urban youth,
the truth of this phrase resonates at multiple levels.
Contextually, such proclamations often came publicly,
after blatant disrespect,
such that recipients of the disrespect were now emotionally taut---
i.e., close to emotionally snapping.
Physically, bodies often mirrored states of mind.
Tension would be etched in tight lines across our forehead,
in our tightly pursed lips, or in our tightly drawn eyelids.

A therapist once told us that people of color
frequently [somatize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatization) their stress.
That is, people of color frequently channel and express their stress
as varied physical ailments and as potentially painful sensations.
Such findings have been reported as far back as the 1990's,
by way of the U.S. Surgeon General ([2001](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK44243/pdf/Bookshelf_NBK44243.pdf), p.60).
Far from an impersonal statistic,
we embody these findings daily,
as we regularly and intensely somatize our stress.

One problem with somatization is that
the chronic, unmitigated stress that is being physically channeled,
harms the mind and body.
A incomplete list of mechanisms of harm includes

- hypertension (high blood pressure)
- postural and musculoskeletal problems
- early onset and increased rate of hair loss
- mental trauma
- and more.

To be clear, it is not that chronic stress is harmful by itself.
For example, think of professional athletes.
They place themselves under chronic physical stress,
however they are often in great health,
at least by a handful of measures.
What seems to crucial to their ability to benefit from chronic stress?
In a word: rest.


## Needs
%%What issue-driving needs does yoga meet?%%

Our unmet need for rest points to a related and complementary,
unmet need for peace.
Of course, life is ever changing,
so we will hardly be at peace all the time.
Accordingly, we need stress mitigation methods---
to restore our sense of peace after we have been (di)stressed.

In particular, we need both physical and mental stress mitigation methods.
Given the intensity and frequency of our somatization,
we need counterbalancing, physical stress mitigation methods,
to calm our body and thereby calm our mind.
For further balance, we also benefit from mental stress mitigation practices,
where we use our mind to calm our bodies (e.g. meditation).
These are of particular help alongside
and, if necessary, as substitutes for our physical stress mitigation methods.


## Yoga
%%What do I mean by yoga and why does it help?%%

One solution that meets both our needs
for physical and mental stress mitigation
is [Yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga).
According to Wikipedia,
one of the central aims of yoga is to "yoke" or harness one's body and mind together,
to attain liberation from suffering (presumably both physical and mental).
That certainly fits our definition of stress mitigation!

There are a great many types of yoga,
i.e. many ways of performing this yoking.
In the United States,
yoga is most associated with yoga poses or postures.
However, in older practices such as [Ashtanga yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashtanga_(eight_limbs_of_yoga))
there are eight parts of yoga,
and only one of them is the postures.
For the sake of our discussion today,
we'll mostly focus on yoga as comprising at least two parts:
breathing and postures.


## Learning and doing
%%What's one process for learning and doing yoga?%%
So, how can we learn and practice yoga?
How can we make use of this stress mitigation tool?

Like any of our other interests,
the first thing we can do is engage with the topic regularly.
In our case, daily or with as high a frequency as we can manage.
We are stressed, even if only in small ways, on a daily basis,
so we may also want to mitigate physical expressions of our stress---
daily, when possible.

In terms of specifics, we have followed the following process.
First, with no pressure, we followed along with online yoga videos
that looked interesting.
Next, we noted and stored videos that we found useful or enjoyable.
We then further stored poses (via screenshots) of poses
that we found useful for relieving tension
or simply enjoyable in physical sensation.
We did the same with descriptions of breathing patterns.
Once we had a small collection of poses (e.g. twelve poses),
we began organizing those poses into physically intuitive sequences.
We then created names, images, and narratives for those sequences,
and we began practicing these sequences daily.
Finally, we committed these patterns, poses, and sequences
to memory using anki flashcards.
These cards are of many varieties, including

- visual anki cards featuring pose recognition,
  node occlusion in diagrams,
  and visualization of poses,
- text based anki cards featuring open-ended responses,
  list recall of pose names,
  and cloze deletion of pose-names in sequences, and
- kinesthetic anki cards featuring "kinesthetic recall"
  (i.e. recall of how poses felt physically)
  and flashcards calling for performance of breathing patterns,
  poses or pose sequences.

All together, these practices multiply encode yoga knowledge
as we accumulate it,
and they present multiple ways of learning and "doing" yoga.


## Big Picture
%%What are the additional meanings for our yoga practice?%%

Given the preceding focus on poses and breathing patterns,
caveats are in order here.
Yoga, and our practice of it, is about far more than
memorization of specific postures
and ways to stay alive (i.e. breathe) while holding them.
There are multiple levels of futher significance to consider.
As mentioned earlier, there are the "Eight Limbs" of Yoga.
We can broader our view even further though.
We can consider yoga and our practice of it
as an example of "kinesthetic thinking," and finally,
we can consider these both within our map of blog contents
and in relation to relevant, existing posts.


### Kinesthetic thinking
 %%What is kinesthetic thinking?%%

First, what do we mean by kinesthetic thinking.
On one hand, we have [prior definitions](https://timothyb0912.github.io/blog/psychology/2021/08/16/Effective-thinking-is-effective-communication.html)
of thinking as internal communication between parts of ourselves.
Here then we might imagine kinesthetic thinking is
internal communication between parts of ourselves
for the purposes of or while making movement.

On the other hand, we can reason by analogy.
Author and graphic facilitator Brandy Agerbeck
has defined visual thinking as
"making a drawing to make meaning for ourselves"
([video](https://youtu.be/iyMite3SKOY?t=30)).
Accordingly, we might then think of kinesthetic thinking as
making movement to make meaning for ourselves.

Putting these two thoughts together,
we define kinesthetic thinking as
internal communication between parts of ourselves
in order to, or while,
making meaning by making movement.
Here, yoga is as an immediate example of kinesthetic thinking.
During yoga, messages are communicated between
various parts of our body and our brain,
and these messages help us make meaning of
how we have been affected by
physical and emotional events in our lives.
Additionally, surely many messages are exchanged between
our brain and body
in order to put ourselves into the various poses.
Perhaps most creatively,
when using anki cards to cue mental recall of how the poses felt,
we are most literally thinking kinesthetically.
This same is true when we use flashcards
to cue performance of specific postures.
 

### Effective thinking
%%How does kinesthetic thinking relate to effective thinking?%%

Continuing along these lines,
we can identify kinesthetic thinking as one mode of [effective thinking](https://timothyb0912.github.io/blog/psychology/2021/08/16/Effective-thinking-is-effective-communication.html).
When thinking effectively, our internal communication consciously aims to meet our needs.
Indeed, in as much as
being aware of and caring for our (physical) state is a need,
and as much as
maintaining minimum levels of peace in our body and mind is a need,
yoga is about internal (brain-body) communication
to make movement in order to meet our peace and awareness needs.
More fundamentally,
yoga is about learning to "yoke" or harness the mind and body together.
The idea is that once harnessed,
we can most effectively direct our mind and body towards meeting our needs.

As [wishfully put](https://isha.sadhguru.org/yoga/yoga-articles-mind-stress/organizing-mind-success/)
by yoga instructor Sadhguru,

> If you bring your mind to a certain level of organization,
> it in turn organizes the other three dimensions of your system---
> your body, emotion, and energies.
> Once these four dimensions are organized in one direction
> and kept unwavering for a certain period,
> [anything you wish](https://isha.sadhguru.org/blog/yoga-meditation/science-of-yoga/harnessing-true-power-of-mind/) will happen.

Though likely false in absolute,
the general principle of harnessing both mind and body
for effective thinking and action is clear.


### Map of blog contents
%%Where does yoga and kinesthetic thinking fit in our map of blog contents?%%

Zooming out, we can place the topic of yoga and kinesthetic thinking
within the broader context of our blog's thoughts.
Increasing the importance we ascribe to yoga and kinesthetic thinking
is a core change in our values / valuation of these activities.
In other words, this is a root cause change, as pictured below.
