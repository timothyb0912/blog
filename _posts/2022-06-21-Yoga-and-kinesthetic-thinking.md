# Yoga and kinesthetic thinking

%%Insert diagram of blog post%%

> Daaaaaaamn, you TIGHT!

So went the familiar refrain across New York City schoolyards
throughout the 2000's.


## Issues
%%What are the issues motivating yoga for me?%%

Dear Young Tim,

Like the best slang sung by urban youth,
the truth of this phrase resonates at multiple levels.
Contextually, such proclamations often came publicly,
after blatant disrespect,
such that recipients of the disrespect were now emotionally taut---
i.e., close to emotionally snapping.
Physically, bodies often mirrored states of mind.
Tension would be etched in tight lines across our forehead,
in our tightly pursed lips, or in our tightly drawn eyelids.

A therapist once told us that people of color
frequently [somatize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatization) their stress.
That is, people of color frequently channel and express their stress
as varied physical ailments and as potentially painful sensations.
Such findings have been reported as far back as the 1990's,
by way of the U.S. Surgeon General ([2001](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK44243/pdf/Bookshelf_NBK44243.pdf)).
Far from just a national statistic,
I embody these findings daily:
I regularly and intensely somatize my stress.

One problem with somatization is that
the chronic, unmitigated stress that is being physically channeled,
harms the mind and body.
A incomplete list of mechanisms of harm includes

- hypertension (high blood pressure)
- postural and musculoskeletal problems
- early onset and increased rate of hair loss
- mental trauma
- and more.

To be clear, it is not that chronic stress is harmful by itself.
For example, think of professional athletes.
They place themselves under chronic physical stress,
however they are often in great health,
at least by a handful of measures.
What seems to crucial to their ability to benefit from chronic stress?
In a word: rest.


## Needs
%%What issue-driving needs does yoga meet?%%

Our unmet need for rest points to a related and complementary,
unmet need for peace.
Of course, life is ever changing,
so we will hardly be at peace all the time.
Accordingly, we need stress mitigation methods---
to restore our sense of peace after we have been (di)stressed.

In particular, we need both physical and mental stress mitigation methods.
Given the intensity and frequency of our somatization,
we need counterbalancing, physical stress mitigation methods,
to calm our body and thereby calm our mind.
For further balance, we also benefit from mental stress mitigation practices,
where we use our mind to calm our bodies (e.g. meditation).
These are of particular help alongside
and, if necessary, as substitutes for our physical stress mitigation methods.


## Yoga
%%What do I mean by yoga and why does it help?%%

One solution that meets both our needs
for physical and mental stress mitigation
is [Yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga).
According to Wikipedia,
one of the central aims of yoga is to "yoke" or harness one's body and mind together,
to attain liberation from suffering (presumably both physical and mental).
That certainly fits our definition of stress mitigation!

There are a great many types of yoga,
i.e. many ways of performing this yoking.
In the United States,
yoga is most associated with yoga poses or postures.
However, in older practices such as [Ashtanga yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashtanga_(eight_limbs_of_yoga))
there are eight parts of yoga,
and only one of them is the postures.
For the sake of our discussion today,
we'll mostly focus on yoga as comprising at least two parts:
breathing and postures.
