# Questions for Introspection

Dear Young Tim,

This note follows up on last months post about a causal graph for introspection.
Here's the graph once more, for memory.
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-09-19_introspection-graph.png">

Today's post lists some questions that you might find useful for directing
your thinking about each node.
Since last months post explained the rationale behind each node,
I'll get straight to the goods!


## Post-decision feelings

### Description
- "What problem am I experiencing?"
- "What do I feel right now, emotionally?"
- "What do I feel right now, physically?"
- "What physical behaviors am I displaying?"
- "What happened just before I started feeling this way?"
- "What was I thinking or saying to myself just before feeling this way?"


### Labelling, chunking, analysis
- "What (emotional/cognitive) parts of us are activated right now?
   What parts of our body feel this activation?"
- "For each emotional/cognitive part of us that is activated,
  i.e. experiencing intense physical feelings:"
  - "What is that part's earliest memory? /
    What's the earliest memory where you felt this way
    or were in this or similar situations?"
  - "How old were you at the time of this earliest memory?"
  - "What does this part want to do?"
  - "What does this part believe, think, or say?"
  - "What is the positive intent of this part and its feelings?"
  - "What role does this part and its feelings play in our
    [internal family system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Family_Systems_Model)?"
  - "What is this part's name?"
- "For each part of you that is activated and desiring behaviors that you see as
  globally unhelpful, what other parts are they protecting?"
- "Are you experiencing any feelings / parts that are polarized
  or wanting opposing things?"
- "What parts of you are stopping you from 'socially undesirable' acts?"


### Immediate response
- "What do I want to feel right now, emotionally?"
- "What do I want to feel right now, physically?"
- "How can we give the active exiles
  (i.e. parts of us with emotional wounds, especially childhood wounds)
  some of what they need **right now**?"
- "How can I activate the parts of me with the emotional and behavioral traits
  I wish to display/use in this situation?"
- "What are the next-best emotional states that we can transition to,
  for example, e.g. fear -> excitement / useful anger?"
- "How can I immediately activate appropriately good feelings?"
  (For example, appreciating a robust challenge.)
