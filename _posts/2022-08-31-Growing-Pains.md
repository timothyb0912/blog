# Growing pains

## 99 problems

Dear Young Tim,

There are times
when we will conclude that
we are facing "tons of problems"---
that there is a lot about our life that we dislike.
Hate it or love it, we are likely to have this experience.
Have hope, however,
for this state and realization is not unique to us.

For instance,
author and motivational speaker Tony Robbins
once [noted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fj1q02w6NmQ&t=1362s) that

> [t]here is a gap between who you are,
> what you want,
> and where you want to be.
> There's a **massive** gap.
> Awareness and the acceptance of that awareness
> is the bridge to the future.

While awareness and acceptance of these gaps
may be our bridges to our best futures,
we still have to cross them.
And like trying to cross a rickety,
wooden suspension bridge
with missing planks:
the experience can evoke
numerous unpleasant feelings
and undesired behaviours
(halting, retreating, panicking, etc.).
These unpleasant feelings are growing pains,
and they are absolutely to be expected.


## Needs

From the perspective of internal family systems (IFS),
we have parts of mind that are activated
when we sense that our needs and desires are unmet,
i.e. when we become aware of the gaps
between who we are, what we want, and where we want to be.
In their activation, these parts of mind generate unpleasant sensations
and they motivate coping behaviors meant to "make us feel better"
or "keep us safe",
regardless of their final or net effects.
For example, we are quite talented
at devouring large quantities of sweet foods when stressed,
at siphoning away our time by escaping into books/shows/fictional-worlds,
and at otherwise ignoring issues,
until we believe we can deal with them.

Instead of employing such dissociative techniques,
we need self-regulatory methods
that re-establish mental and emotional "okay-ness"
while accepting awareness of our present reality
AND while preventing or minimizing
detrimental second-order effects of our actions.
In IFS terms, we need ways of re-establishing
a sense of "Self", wherein we feel:

 > calmness, clarity, curiosity, creativity
 > courage, confidence, connection, compassion,
 > perspective, presence, patience,
 > playfulness, and persistence.
 

Today, we'll focus on a subset of these qualities,
and on related methods we've found useful for bringing them about.
