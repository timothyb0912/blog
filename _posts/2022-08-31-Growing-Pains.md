# Growing pains

## 99 problems

Dear Young Tim,

There are times
when we will conclude
we are facing "tons of problems"
and that there is much about our life that we dislike.
In this particular brand of displeasure,
we will have plenty of company.

For instance,
author and motivational speaker Tony Robbins
once [noted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fj1q02w6NmQ&t=1362s) that

> [t]here is a gap between who you are,
> what you want,
> and where you want to be.
> There's a **massive** gap.
> Awareness and the acceptance of that awareness
> is the bridge to the future.

While awareness and acceptance of these gaps
may be our bridges to our best futures,
we still have to cross them.
And like trying to cross a rickety,
wooden suspension bridge
with missing planks:
the experience can evoke
numerous unpleasant feelings
and undesired behaviours
(freezing, panicking, retreating, etc.).
These unpleasant feelings are growing pains,
and they are absolutely to be expected.


## Needs

From the perspective of internal family systems (IFS),
we have parts of mind that are activated
when we sense that our needs and desires are unmet,
i.e. when we become aware of the gaps
between who we are, what we want, and where we want to be.
In their activation,
these parts of mind generate unpleasant sensations
and they motivate coping behaviors meant to "make us feel better"
or to "keep us safe",
regardless of the net effects.
For example, we are quite talented
at devouring large quantities of sweet foods when stressed,
at siphoning away our time by escaping into books/shows/fictional-worlds,
and at otherwise ignoring issues,
until we believe we can deal with them.

Instead of employing such dissociative techniques,
we need self-regulatory methods
that re-establish mental and emotional "okay-ness"
while accepting awareness of our present reality
AND while preventing or minimizing
detrimental second-order effects of our actions.
In IFS terms, we need ways of re-establishing
a sense of "Self", wherein we feel:

 > calmness, clarity, curiosity, creativity
 > courage, confidence, connection, compassion,
 > perspective, presence, patience,
 > playfulness, and persistence.
 

Today, we'll focus on a subset of these qualities,
and on related methods we've found useful for bringing them about.


## Reminders of Gendlin's Litany
Let's start with calmness and clarity.
We cannot have clarity about something,
if we cannot see and sense that thing closely.
However,
establishing calmness often starts
by distancing ourselves from painful experiences.
Do we not immediately pull away from painfully hot items to prevent burns?
Do we not immediately look away from the sun to prevent eye damage?
How then can we pursue both calmness and clarity
with regard to our growing pains?

One line of thinking is given in
[Causally Engineering Life](https://timothyb0912.github.io/blog/reading/2021/02/28/Causally-Engineering-Life.html).
If our immediate response is to seek calmness
by distancing or otherwise dissociating ourselves
from painful realizations of our life's problems,
then our procedural and root cause responses
remain opportunities for building and for building from clarity.
To effectively respond to our problems by
changing what we do and how we are,
we benefit from looking at and studying our problems.
Here, staying calm allows long-enough engagement with our problems
so we can usefully learn about them and how we contribute to them.

Regularly reviewing affirmations has helped
us more calmly observe the problems in our life's systems.
For example, it is especially helpful to remember
the [Litany of Gendlin](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/litany-of-gendlin), that

> [w]hat is true is already so.
> Owning up to it doesn't make it worse.
> Not being open about it doesn't make it go away.
> And because it's true, it is what is there to be interacted with.
> Anything untrue isn't there to be lived.
> People can stand what is true,
> for they are already enduring it.
> ---philosopher and psychologist Eugene Gendlin,
>      Focusing, ch 11 The Listening Manual

Though our initial reaction is
to shrink away from the sight of our broken life systems,
much like we'd shrink away from the sight of broken bones,
looking at our problems does not intrinsically make them worse.
Further, ignoring the problem doesn't make it disappear.
And finally,
we already endure the negative consequences of our broken systems,
even if we don't look at the dysfunctions directly.
In fact, looking at what's broken is the first step to fixing it.

Remembering that we are already impacted,
that observing doesn't make our problems worse,
and that we need to look at our problems to resolve them
helps us remain calm while surveying our wreckages.
Procedurally, cloze-deletion anki-flashcards
promote our remembering of Gendlin's Litany.
Anki's spaced repetition helps ensure the knowledge is generally accessible.
By tagging this and other affirmations,
we further facilitate in-the-moment self-regulation
with "custom study sessions,"
whenever stress from life-system firefighting
triggers our dissociating reflexes.
