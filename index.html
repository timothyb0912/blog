This site contains my personal blog.

It's a place for my thoughts, reflections, and short snippets of code to demonstrate my ideas.<br>
Structurally, it's a series of letters with helpful advice to my [younger self](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1336428-to-take-good-care-of-ourselves-we-must-go-back).

This site is built with [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), an easy to use blogging platform with extra features for Jupyter Notebooks.
