<p>Dear Young Tim,</p>

<p>Happy New Year and welcome to 2021!
As with every new year, January has brought a flurry of change.
And with change comes growing pains.</p>

<p>Specifically, both at work and at home,
I experienced a series of intermittent, system failure incidents.
These incidents were caused by both changing circumstances and
lack of sufficiently robust preventative measures.
Moreover, the failures have been widespread,
including everything from home plumbing systems,
to time management systems, to software systems.
As the old saying goes,
“when it rains, <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/when%20it%20rains,%20it%20pours">it pours</a>.”</p>

<p>When responding to the simultaneous failure of many systems,
what I often need the most is to know an <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/algorithm">algorithm</a>:
(1) what to do, and (2) step-by-step instructions of how to do it.
Indeed, when the spout in my bathroom is leaking heavily,
all I want is to know how to fix it—quickly.</p>

<p>Curiously, the need for knowing what and how to do things
exists outside of incident response.
For instance, to collaborate well with others,
it’s helpful if I am clear about what I will do and how I will do it.
Likewise, to successfully delegate a task to someone else,
both I and the person doing the task need to be completely clear on
what the task entails and how it should be done.</p>

<p>Even when only considering how I work, as opposed to how I work with others,
it is helpful to be clear about what I should do and how I do them.
In particular, if I want my products and services to be of high quality,
by default, then I likely need to standardize my processes around
pre-determined methods that yield high quality results.
Similarly, if I want to accurately plan my time and projects,
standardizing around a set of procedures for what and how to do something allows
apples-to-apples comparisons and estimates of how long that and similar tasks
will take in the future.
And finally, if I want to improve my process for doing something,
having a standardized process simplifies matters greatly compared to an erratic
process. It’s hard to tell signal from noise when the variance is high!</p>

<p>Young Tim, you will always deal with problematic systems;
you will always accomplish more by working with others than alone;
and you will always be busy planning and trying to improve yourself.
Accordingly, you should meticulously record the procedures for all tasks
that are necessary for the correct functioning of any systems
that you are responsible for.</p>

<p>Why?
Because if you document the algorithms and
procedures for doing everything needed to keep your systems working,
then you can live with greater peace knowing that when something breaks,
you’ll have knowledge to fix it.
Additionally, you’ll be more excited about life when you can take
an otherwise abstract process that isn’t working well,
and visibly transform it into a process that you expect to be better.
Finally, if you diligently make use of your documented procedures
and if you track your time while doing so,
then you’ll be able to make better decisions and plans
because you will have more usable information (i.e. standardized / cleaned)
and more useful information (i.e. apples-to-apples with less missing data).</p>

<p>Okay if above sounds reasonable and you want some lighthearted reinforcement,
or if you want a pictorial, minimal-word TL;DR, see the following <a href="https://cicero.xyz/v3/remark/0.14.0/github.com/timothyb0912/algo_slides/stable/algo_slides.md/#1">presentation</a>:</p>

<p>Lastly, see the following <a href="https://github.com/timothyb0912/templates/blob/develop/docs/HOW-PROCEDURES_TEMPLATE.md">template</a> for writing how-to guides as a starting point
for documenting your own procedures and algorithms.</p>

<p>Till next time,</p>

<!-- ## Outline

- Intro: New Year & change
  - "Dear Young Tim, Happy New Year and welcome to 2021! As with every new year, January has brought a flurry of change. And with change comes growing pains."
- Context:
  - change or otherwise induced firefighting-for-my-responsibilities at personal & work,
  - "Both at work and at home, changing circumstances and lack of sufficiently robust preventative measures have led to a series of system failure incidents. This includes everything from home plumbing systems, to time management systems, to software systems."
- Need: knowing what to do and how to do it, i.e an algorithm.
  - "In the face of such problems, I want to stabilize the damaged or errant system in my life.
  Unfortunately, across all tasks, stabilization requires me to know what to do and how to do it."
- Context elaboration
  - "Even beyond system stabilization, I find myself in need of knowing what to do and how to do it."
  - collaboration + delegation / load-sharing at work + personal,
  - standardization of (high) quality
  - planning / duration estimation
- Decision: "document everything I repeatedly need to do"
- Why?
  - "By documenting all of repeatedly used procedures and why I do them the way I do, I gain peace, excitement, and efficiency in my life."
  - peace of mind as I deal with my own issues
  - peace of mind as others deal with my or their own issues
  - excitement as I make my procedures better and better
  - efficiency as I make decisions with better information
- TL;DR?: "For a pictorial explanation of this post's main points, see the following presentation."
